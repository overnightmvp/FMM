<objective>
Create docs/BOILERPLATE-NEW-CITY-ONBOARDING.md — a master replication guide that synthesizes all FMM docs into a step-by-step playbook for launching the labor-only moving lead gen model in a new city (Charlotte, Austin, Tampa, etc.).

Purpose: FMM is built to replicate across cities. The boilerplate is what makes that replication possible in 2-3 weeks instead of 2-3 months. It synthesizes the 90-minute execution guide, contractor research process, email templates, success metrics, and technical setup into a single authoritative guide an operator can hand to a contractor or junior team member.

Output: A comprehensive markdown document at docs/BOILERPLATE-NEW-CITY-ONBOARDING.md with 6 sections, [PLACEHOLDER] markers for city-specific variables, cross-references to all FMM template docs, and explicit guidance on which elements need customization vs. which are universal.

    # LABOR-ONLY MOVING LEAD GEN — NEW CITY ONBOARDING BOILERPLATE
    ## Version 1.0 | Based on Fort Myers, FL launch (Feb 2026)

    **Model**: Generate exclusive labor-only moving leads at $75/lead for local moving contractors.
    **Proven In**: Fort Myers, FL (Lee County / Collier County market)
    **Target Cities for Expansion**: Charlotte, NC | Austin, TX | Tampa, FL | Nashville, TN
    **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks from zero to first leads flowing
    **Revenue Model**: 100 leads/month × $75 = $7,500/month per city

    ---

    ## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

    This is a step-by-step replication guide. Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] markers with city-specific values. Cross-references to FMM docs indicate which templates to copy and adapt. Do not start Section 2 until Section 1's Go/No-Go decision is complete.

    **[CITY_NAME]** — Replace with target city (e.g., "Charlotte")
    **[CITY_STATE]** — Replace with state abbreviation (e.g., "NC")
    **[METRO_AREA]** — Replace with broader metro (e.g., "Charlotte, Concord, Gastonia")
    **[AREA_CODE]** — Replace with local area code (e.g., "704")
    **[PEAK_MONTHS]** — Replace with local peak moving season (e.g., "April-June, August-September" for Charlotte)
    **[SNOWBIRD_MARKET]** — YES or NO (Fort Myers = YES; Charlotte, Austin = NO)
    ```

    SECTION 1: PRE-LAUNCH RESEARCH (Days 1-2)
    Title: "Section 1: Market Research — Is [CITY_NAME] a Go?"

    Sub-sections:
    1.1 Market Sizing Worksheet
    - Fill-in table: Population, Homeownership Rate (%), Annual Move Rate (%), Total Annual Moves, Target Market Share (5%), Your Addressable Leads/Year, Leads/Month at Target Share
    - Benchmark: Fort Myers = 800K metro, 67% homeownership, 12% move rate, ~64K moves/year, 3,200 target share, ~267 leads/month
    - Formula: Population × homeownership % × move rate % × 5% market share ÷ 12 = monthly lead target
    - Go threshold: Monthly addressable leads > 150. Below 150 = too small, skip city.

    1.2 Competitor Analysis Template
    Table with rows: Thumbtack presence (Y/N + estimated # contractors listed), Angi/HomeAdvisor presence, Facebook moving groups, Local aggregators (MoversDirect, etc.), National franchise movers (Two Men, College Hunks), Our advantage
    - Note: If Thumbtack has fewer than 20 local moving contractors, the market is underserved = opportunity. If 50+, market is saturated = harder entry.

    1.3 Seasonal Demand Profile
    - [SNOWBIRD_MARKET] = YES: Use Fort Myers model — peak Nov-Apr, secondary May-Jun, maintenance Jul-Oct
    - [SNOWBIRD_MARKET] = NO: Identify local peak — generally April-June (school-year transitions), August-September (back-to-school), moderate rest of year
    - Note cities with military bases (Jacksonville FL, San Antonio TX, Hampton Roads VA): Military family moves add stable year-round demand, adjust targeting accordingly.
    - Ad spend calendar template: Peak months ($80-100/day) vs. off-peak ($20-30/day)

    1.4 Lead Qualification Criteria (Customize Per City)
    Universal criteria (never change):
    - Ready to move within 30 days
    - 2+ bedroom minimum (smaller jobs aren't worth $75/lead to contractors)
    - Labor-only service area (no truck provided — contractor brings crew)
    Geographic criteria (customize per city):
    - Fort Myers: Lee County + north Collier County (within 40-mile radius of Fort Myers)
    - [CITY_NAME]: [METRO_AREA] within [X]-mile radius — define this before launching ads
    Seasonal criteria (if snowbird market):
    - Include: "Moving into seasonal residence" and "Moving out of seasonal residence" — these are high-value leads for Fort Myers-style markets

    1.5 Pricing Validation
    - Research what local movers pay on Thumbtack/Angi/HomeAdvisor for moving leads
    - Formula: Our price ($75) should be ≤ what they currently pay per lead, OR we offer exclusive (no competition) which justifies paying up to 2x current platform price
    - ROI check: $75 lead × contractor average job value ($800-1,500) = 10-20x ROI. Any contractor rejecting this math has bad margins.
    - If market has lower average job values (small apartments, college towns), consider $50/lead pricing.

    1.6 Go/No-Go Scorecard
    Scored checklist (add up points):
    - [ ] Metro population > 500K (+2)
    - [ ] Monthly addressable leads > 150 (+2)
    - [ ] Homeownership rate > 55% (+1)
    - [ ] Thumbtack has < 30 contractors listed (+2)
    - [ ] No dominant local aggregator (+1)
    - [ ] 10+ local moving companies found on Google Maps (+1)
    - [ ] Average contractor reviews < 4.3/5 (room to help quality operators stand out) (+1)
    GO if score ≥ 7. HOLD if 5-6 (reassess in 90 days). NO GO if < 5.

    SECTION 2: TECHNICAL SETUP (Days 3-5)
    Title: "Section 2: Technical Setup — Getting the Site Live"

    2.1 Landing Page Customization
    - Base: Copy /landing-page/index.html from Fort Myers template
    - Find/replace these 6 variables:
      * "Fort Myers" → "[CITY_NAME]"
      * "Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, Naples, Estero" → "[METRO_AREA cities]"
      * "(239) 555-MOVE" → "[AREA_CODE]-XXX-XXXX" (get Google Voice number first)
      * "Lee County" / "Collier County" → "[CITY] metro service area"
      * "snowbird" references → Adapt for local seasonality (or remove if [SNOWBIRD_MARKET]=NO)
      * GA4 Measurement ID → New GA4 property for this city
    - Hosting: Netlify (free tier). Connect new GitHub repo. Deploy in <10 minutes.
    - Domain: [city]-labor-movers.com or [city]-moving-help.com (check availability on Namecheap, ~$10/year)

    2.2 Form Setup
    - Service: Formspree (free tier: 50 submissions/month; paid $8/month for unlimited)
    - Create new form at formspree.io — copy the endpoint URL (format: https://formspree.io/f/XXXXXX)
    - Replace Fort Myers endpoint in landing page HTML
    - Configure email notification to go to your email AND contractor's email
    - Test: Submit form from mobile device, confirm email arrives within 60 seconds

    2.3 Phone Setup
    - Get Google Voice number with [AREA_CODE] area code (free)
    - Alternative: CallRail ($45/month) if you need call tracking analytics
    - Update landing page phone number and clickable tel: link
    - Set up voicemail greeting: "You've reached [CITY_NAME] Moving Help. Leave your name, phone, and move date and we'll call you right back."

    2.4 Analytics Setup
    - Create new GA4 property in Google Analytics for [CITY_NAME] market
    - Add tracking code to landing page <head>
    - Create conversion events: form_submit, phone_click, page_scroll_75
    - UTM parameter structure for ads: utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=[city]-movers&utm_content=[ad-creative-name]
    - Reference: Fort Myers analytics setup in FMM-90-minute-execution.md Phase 4

    2.5 Launch QA Checklist
    - [ ] Landing page loads on mobile (test on both iOS and Android)
    - [ ] Form submits successfully (test submission, verify email notification)
    - [ ] Phone number is clickable on mobile (tap-to-call)
    - [ ] Google Analytics tracking active (real-time view shows page view)
    - [ ] Page speed score > 80 (test at pagespeed.web.dev)

    SECTION 3: CONTRACTOR ACQUISITION (Days 6-10)
    Title: "Section 3: Finding and Signing Your First Contractor"

    3.1 Prospect Research Process
    Step-by-step:
    1. Google: "moving company [CITY_NAME]" — open top 10 Google Business profiles
    2. Google: "labor only movers [CITY_NAME]" — find specialists
    3. Thumbtack: Search "[CITY_NAME] movers" — note which companies are listed but have poor profiles
    4. Filter: Keep only companies with 3.8+ stars, 15+ reviews, within service area
    5. Research each: website quality (mobile-friendly?), Thumbtack/Angi presence, estimated size (1 truck = Tier 1 target)

    Use docs/contractor-research.md as the template — create [CITY_NAME]-contractor-research.md by copying and replacing all Fort Myers-specific details.

    Tier classification guidance:
    - Tier 1 (priority): Owner-operated, 1-3 trucks, 4+ stars, minimal web presence, likely relies on word-of-mouth
    - Tier 2: Medium size, using Thumbtack/Angi but complaining about lead quality online
    - Tier 3: Established movers who need overflow volume in slow months

    3.2 Outreach Execution
    - Use docs/email-templates.md as base — customize city name, seasonal references, competitor names
    - Template 1 (Tier 1): Replace "Fort Myers" with "[CITY_NAME]", replace "snowbird season" with "[local season peak]"
    - Template 2 (Tier 2): Works almost as-is — just replace city name and Thumbtack competitor count
    - Template 3 (Tier 3): Replace seasonal references with [CITY_NAME] local seasonality

    3.3 Demo Call Script
    When a contractor responds:
    Opening: "Thanks for getting back to me. I'm running a moving lead generation service specifically for [CITY_NAME] — exclusive leads, no competition. I wanted to show you how it works."
    Qualify them: "How many moves are you doing per month right now? What's your average job value?"
    Pitch: "We send you pre-qualified homeowners who are ready to move within 30 days, in your service area. You pay $75/lead. No platform fees, no competing with 10 other movers."
    Close: "We could start sending you 10-15 leads per month. First 5 leads are on us — if you don't like the quality, no obligation. Want to try it?"
    Payment setup: Stripe invoice at end of month for all leads delivered. Net-15 payment terms.

    3.4 Contractor Onboarding Checklist
    - [ ] Signed lead purchase agreement (simple 1-page doc)
    - [ ] Payment method on file (Stripe card or ACH)
    - [ ] Lead routing set up (their email + phone added to Zapier notification)
    - [ ] Service area defined (which zip codes they cover)
    - [ ] Lead criteria agreed (move size minimum, max distance, home types)
    - [ ] First week check-in scheduled (24 hours after first lead delivered)

    SECTION 4: CAMPAIGN LAUNCH (Week 2)
    Title: "Section 4: Running Facebook Ads in [CITY_NAME]"

    4.1 Facebook Campaign Setup
    - Business Manager: Create new ad account for [CITY_NAME] market (keep separate from Fort Myers)
    - Campaign objective: Lead Generation OR Traffic (test both in week 1)
    - Audience targeting:
      * Location: [CITY_NAME] + [METRO_AREA] cities, +25 mile radius
      * Age: 35-65 (homeowners more likely to hire movers)
      * Interests: Home improvement, Real estate, Moving, Storage units
      * Exclude: Apartment renters, students
    - Daily budget: $30-50/day test budget (first 2 weeks)
    - Scale to: $80-100/day during peak months once CPL < $50

    4.2 Ad Creative Guidelines
    What works for moving ads:
    - Headline: "[CITY_NAME] Moving Help — We Send the Crew" or "Labor-Only Movers in [CITY_NAME]"
    - Body: "No truck needed. We send experienced movers to load/unload. Only $[X] for 2 hours."
    - CTA button: "Get a Free Quote" or "Book Now"
    - Image: Clean, professional photo of movers carrying boxes OR a moving truck (stock is fine)
    - Avoid: Cluttered visuals, too much text, generic "moving company" photos

    4.3 Lead Quality Control
    Filter criteria before routing to contractor:
    - Must have: Name, Phone, Move date (within 30 days), Service address
    - Geographic: Within contractor's defined service area zip codes
    - Size: Must specify 2+ bedrooms OR "large items" (piano, safe, etc.)
    - Reject: Empty phone number, fake-looking names, move date > 60 days out

    4.4 First Week Optimization
    Daily check (takes 10 minutes):
    - CPL below $60? Keep running.
    - CPL above $60? Pause worst-performing ad set, test new creative.
    - Lead quality complaints from contractor? Tighten geographic targeting.
    - Less than 2 leads/day? Increase daily budget by $10/day.

    Reference: systems/success-metrics.md for all KPI targets and red/yellow flag thresholds.

    SECTION 5: OPERATIONS & SCALING (Week 3+)
    Title: "Section 5: Running the Business Day-to-Day"

    5.1 Lead Tracking Setup
    Google Sheets template columns:
    Date | Lead Name | Phone | Email | Move Date | Zip Code | Status (New/Routed/Accepted/Rejected) | Contractor Assigned | Invoice #
    - Create one sheet per city
    - Link to Formspree via Zapier (Formspree → Google Sheets row)
    - Add conditional formatting: New = yellow, Accepted = green, Rejected = red

    5.2 Zapier Automation
    Trigger: New Formspree submission
    Actions (in order):
    1. Add row to Google Sheets
    2. Send SMS to contractor: "NEW LEAD: [Name], [Phone], Moving [Date], [Zip]. Reply ACCEPTED or REJECTED."
    3. Send confirmation email to lead (optional — set expectations on when contractor will call)

    5.3 Invoicing Process
    - Monthly invoice to contractor via Stripe or Wave (free)
    - Invoice covers: All accepted leads for the month
    - Terms: Net-15 (due 15 days after invoice date)
    - If contractor disputes a lead: Credit criteria are pre-agreed (wrong geo, fake phone, etc.)
    - Red flag: Any contractor with > 25% rejection rate needs a quality review conversation

    5.4 KPI Tracking Rhythm
    Daily (5 minutes): Check Formspree for new leads, verify Zapier ran correctly, check ad CPL in Facebook
    Weekly (30 minutes): Review Google Sheets for lead volume trends, check contractor acceptance rate, review ad performance
    Monthly (1 hour): Calculate P&L, issue contractor invoices, review CPL vs. target, assess whether to scale or optimize
    Reference: systems/success-metrics.md for all targets, warning thresholds, and daily monitoring checklist.

    5.5 Contractor Retention
    First 30 days are critical. Retention tactics:
    - Week 1: Call contractor after their first 3 leads. Ask: "Did the leads match your criteria? Any issues?"
    - Week 2: Share their acceptance rate (ideally 80%+). Celebrate their wins.
    - Month 1 review: Share P&L summary for their account — show them their ROI clearly
    - Risk: If contractor goes quiet for 7+ days, call them — non-response often means dissatisfaction
    - Churn prevention: If CPL rises above $60 and acceptance rate drops below 70%, fix before contractor notices

    SECTION 6: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION (Month 2+)
    Title: "Section 6: Scaling to City 2 and Beyond"

    6.1 When to Expand
    Checklist — expand only when ALL are true:
    - [ ] City 1 generating ≥ 75 leads/month consistently for 60+ days
    - [ ] City 1 CPL below $50 and stable
    - [ ] City 1 has ≥ 2 active contractors with ≥ 80% acceptance rate
    - [ ] City 1 operations require < 2 hours/week of your time (automation working)
    - [ ] You have capacity for 3-5 additional hours/week for city 2 ramp-up

    6.2 City Selection Framework
    Top priority expansion markets (based on Fort Myers model applicability):
    1. Tampa, FL — Snowbird market, similar seasonality, large metro (3.2M), high homeownership
    2. Charlotte, NC — No snowbird season, but massive growth market (1.8M metro, 40K+ moves/year)
    3. Austin, TX — Tech-heavy renter market, but high move rates (15%+ annually), competitive but large
    4. Nashville, TN — Growing market, limited local aggregators, strong contractor landscape
    Score each city using Section 1.6 Go/No-Go Scorecard before committing.

    6.3 What Transfers Directly (No Changes Needed)
    - Landing page HTML (swap city name + phone number)
    - Email templates (swap city name + seasonal references)
    - Contractor research process (same Tier 1/2/3 framework)
    - Zapier automation (replicate workflow, change form endpoint)
    - Success metrics targets (same KPI thresholds)
    - Invoicing process (same Stripe setup, new contractor accounts)

    6.4 What Requires City-Specific Customization
    - Seasonal demand calendar (snowbird vs. school-year vs. military-driven demand)
    - Service area zip codes (define the geographic boundary for contractor routing)
    - Competitor analysis (local Thumbtack landscape varies significantly by city)
    - Ad targeting (age/interest mix may shift based on demographics)
    - Lead qualification criteria (apartment vs. single-family mix varies; rural vs. dense urban)

    6.5 Expansion Timeline (90 Days)
    - Days 1-7: Market research + Go/No-Go decision (Section 1)
    - Days 8-14: Landing page live, form working, phone set up (Section 2)
    - Days 15-21: First contractor emails sent, demo calls scheduled (Section 3)
    - Days 22-28: First contractor signed, Facebook ads live at $30/day (Section 4)
    - Days 29-60: Optimize to CPL < $50, sign 2nd contractor (Section 5)
    - Days 61-90: 50+ leads/month flowing, operations < 2 hrs/week, assess city 3 (Section 6)

- docs/BOILERPLATE-NEW-CITY-ONBOARDING.md: A complete, production-ready replication playbook that someone could hand to a junior operator and say "follow this to launch the moving lead gen model in Charlotte"
- All 6 sections present with concrete action steps, not abstract guidance
- Every variable that needs city-specific customization has a [PLACEHOLDER] marker and a Fort Myers example
- The Go/No-Go scorecard in Section 1 prevents launching in markets that won't work
- Cross-references to all Wave 1 template docs make the boilerplate a hub that links to the full playbook
- Version history table establishes this as v1.0, with a clear plan to update after first expansion city launch
