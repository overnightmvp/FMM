<objective>
Create omvp-fmm-dashboard.html — a project management dashboard for Fort Myers Movers that opens in a browser, shows a launch checklist with persistent checkboxes, links to all operational docs, displays key metrics targets, and includes a seasonal calendar.

Purpose: FMM lacks a centralized command center. The HVAC project has a simple HTML dashboard that works well. FMM needs the same pattern adapted to the moving model with links to all Wave 1 docs plus existing project files.

Output: A single self-contained HTML file at the project root that loads instantly, requires no build system, and serves as the daily operational hub for managing the FMM lead gen business.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create omvp-fmm-dashboard.html</name>
  <files>omvp-fmm-dashboard.html</files>
  <action>
    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/OMVP-hvac copy/omvp-hvac-dashboard.html first for the structural pattern.
    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/landing-page/assets/movers.css first 100 lines to extract design tokens.

    Create omvp-fmm-dashboard.html at /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/omvp-fmm-dashboard.html.

    The dashboard is pure HTML/CSS/JS — no build system, no npm, no external frameworks beyond Google Fonts (Inter). Use inline <style> block. Link to Google Fonts for Inter.

    DESIGN SYSTEM — use these exact values from movers.css (implement as inline CSS variables in :root):
    - --color-primary: #1e3a8a (deep navy)
    - --color-accent: #f97316 (orange CTA)
    - --color-warning: #dc2626 (red)
    - --color-trust: #16a34a (green)
    - --color-bg: #ffffff
    - --color-bg-alt: #f8fafc
    - --color-text: #111827
    - --color-text-muted: #6b7280
    - --color-border: #e5e7eb
    - Font: Inter from Google Fonts
    - --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
    - --shadow-md: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.10)
    - --radius-md: 12px

    PAGE STRUCTURE:
    1. <head>: charset, viewport, title "Fort Myers Movers Dashboard", Google Fonts Inter, inline <style>
    2. <body>: .container (max-width 1160px, margin auto, padding 2rem)
    3. Top header: h1 "Fort Myers Movers — Operations Dashboard", subtitle "Labor-Only Moving Lead Generation | Fort Myers, FL"
    4. Context banner (styled like HVAC's brutal-reality, but use --color-primary border, --color-bg-alt background):
       - Title: "The Mission"
       - Body: "Goal: $7,500/month in moving leads. Model: Generate labor-only moving leads for Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Naples at $75/lead exclusive. No platforms, no competition. Snowbird season Nov–Apr is peak. Get contractors set up before October."
       - Link to landing-page/index.html ("View Landing Page")
    5. 4-column grid (auto-fit, minmax 280px):
       - Card 1: Launch Checklist
       - Card 2: Project Links
       - Card 3: Key Metrics
       - Card 4: Seasonal Calendar
    6. Below grid: a second 2-column row:
       - Card 5: Contractor Status
       - Card 6: Ad Campaign Tracker

    CARD 1 — Launch Checklist ("Week 1-2 Launch Tasks"):
    Checkboxes that persist in localStorage. Each checkbox: id="task-N", saved/loaded on page load.

    2. Set up Formspree account + connect to landing-page form
    3. Configure Google Analytics 4 on landing-page/index.html
    4. Test form submission end-to-end (mobile + desktop)
    5. Research 10 Fort Myers/Cape Coral moving companies (see contractor-research.md)
    6. Send outreach emails to Tier 1 prospects (use email-templates.md Template 1)
    7. Set up Google Sheets lead tracker (Name, Phone, Move Date, Zip, Status)
    8. Set up Zapier: Formspree → Google Sheets → SMS to contractor
    9. Launch Facebook ads ($30/day, Fort Myers homeowners 45-65, moving interests)
    10. First contractor signed and receiving leads

    - Profit Margin Target: > 60%
    - Contractors Active Target: 3-5

    Style each metric with label in --color-text-muted (small caps), value in --color-primary (bold 1.25rem).
    Add small note at bottom: "Peak = Nov–Apr (snowbird season). Off-peak = May–Oct."

    CARD 4 — Seasonal Calendar ("Demand Seasons"):
    Simple visual list — use colored left-border bars per season:
    - NOV – APR: "PEAK SEASON" (green border, --color-trust) — "Snowbirds arriving. Move-ins, move-outs, storage transitions. Run $80-100/day ads. Max contractor capacity."
    - MAY – JUN: "SECONDARY PEAK" (orange border, --color-accent) — "Summer residential moves. Local families, school-year timing. Run $50/day ads."
    - JUL – AUG: "MAINTENANCE" (gray border) — "Slower period. Reduce ad spend to $20-30/day. Focus on contractor retention + optimization."
    - SEP – OCT: "RAMP UP" (blue border, --color-primary) — "Snowbirds returning. Increase budget. Get new contractors onboarded before peak season."

    Static table with placeholder rows (editable manually):
    Columns: Contractor | Status | Leads/Month | Revenue | Since
    3 placeholder rows with "(Add contractor)" in first cell, all other cells "--"
    Add note: "Update manually as contractors are onboarded. See systems/lead-routing-setup.md for routing logic."

    - Zapier Dashboard (https://zapier.com/app/dashboard)

    JAVASCRIPT:
    - On page load: Read localStorage for all task-N checkbox states. Set checked attribute accordingly.
    - On each checkbox change: Save to localStorage key "fmm-task-N" with value "true"/"false"
    - Add "Reset All" button below checklist that clears localStorage and unchecks all boxes

Open omvp-fmm-dashboard.html in browser: all 6 cards visible, no broken layout.
Check all 10 checkboxes, refresh page — checked state persists.
Click each doc link — verify path resolves (file should exist for Wave 1 outputs, others are navigable markdown files).
Color scheme matches site: navy (#1e3a8a) headers, orange (#f97316) accents.
Page title reads "Fort Myers Movers Dashboard".
