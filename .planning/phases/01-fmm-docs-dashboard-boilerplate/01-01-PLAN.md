<objective>
Create two operational docs adapted from the HVAC source for Fort Myers Movers (FMM): a 90-minute execution guide and a success metrics KPI framework.

Purpose: FMM currently lacks a structured launch execution guide and a defined KPI tracking system. These are operational foundations needed before launching ads and contractor outreach.

Output: Two production-quality markdown documents at docs/FMM-90-minute-execution.md and systems/success-metrics.md, both adapted from HVAC equivalents with FMM-specific language, targets, and Fort Myers seasonal context.

  <name>Task 1: Create docs/FMM-90-minute-execution.md</name>
  <files>docs/FMM-90-minute-execution.md</files>
  <action>
    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/OMVP-hvac copy/docs/90-minute-execution.md first. Then READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/docs/market-intel.md for FMM-specific details.

    Create docs/FMM-90-minute-execution.md at /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/docs/FMM-90-minute-execution.md adapting the HVAC structure with these specific changes:

    KEEP from HVAC:
    - 4-phase structure (Foundation 20min, Content Creation 25min, Outreach Preparation 25min, Launch Preparation 20min)
    - Checkbox task format with time targets per task
    - Success metrics section at the end
    - "Focus on what converts" ethos

    CHANGE for FMM (never use HVAC-specific language):
    - Title: "90-MINUTE FORT MYERS MOVERS LAUNCH EXECUTION PLAN"
    - Goal: "Generate first moving lead within 48 hours. First contractor signed within 7 days."
    - Target revenue: "$1,500/month from first contractor within 2 weeks"
    - Phase 1 market intel: Search "labor only movers Fort Myers" and "moving help Fort Myers FL" — find 3-5 local moving ops with bad websites
    - Phase 1 landing page: Already built (landing-page/index.html). Task is customizing phone number, service areas (Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, Naples, Estero), and form endpoint
    - Phase 1 lead capture: Formspree setup for form at landing-page/index.html
    - Phase 1 validation: Check Google Trends for "moving help Fort Myers" + confirm snowbird season Nov-Apr as primary demand window
    - Phase 2 content: Headlines for moving labor ("Need Help Moving? We Send the Crew"), focus on snowbird move-in/move-out messaging, stress: no truck needed, labor only
    - Phase 2 Facebook ad copy: Target homeowners 45-70 (snowbird demographic), Fort Myers/Cape Coral/Naples targeting
    - Phase 3 contractor research: Google Maps "moving company Fort Myers" — focus on small ops (1-5 trucks) with 4+ stars but minimal web presence
    - Phase 3 email templates: Problem = "You're losing jobs to Thumbtack/TaskRabbit because you don't show up in mobile searches." Solution = "$75/lead exclusively to you, no competition"
    - Phase 3 ROI calc: Lead cost $75 / Average job value $800-1,200 = 10-16x ROI. At 15 leads/month = $1,125/month contractor spends to generate $12,000-18,000 revenue
    - Phase 4 analytics: GA4 setup with moving-specific events (form_submit, phone_click, map_interaction)
    - Phase 4 lead routing: Formspree → Gmail → contractor SMS notification via Zapier
    - Success metrics (48 hours): 3 contractor emails sent, $30 Facebook ad spend test, 1 form submission, 1 contractor interest reply
    - Critical next steps: Fort Myers phone number (Google Voice), contractor outreach list from docs/contractor-research.md (when created), $100 test ad budget
    - Bottom line reminder: "Peak snowbird season Nov-Apr. Contractors who get set up in October always have their best winter. Don't wait."

    Format: Use same markdown structure as HVAC source. Use checkbox lists for all tasks. Use Phase/Task headers with time estimates.

    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/OMVP-hvac copy/systems/success-metrics.md first. Then READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/systems/pricing-guide.md for FMM pricing context.

    Create systems/success-metrics.md at /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/systems/success-metrics.md adapting the HVAC KPI framework with these specific changes:

    KEEP from HVAC:
    - 4 primary KPI table structure (CPL, Lead Quality Score, Daily Lead Volume, Form Conversion Rate)
    - Revenue metrics table (MRR, Profit Margin, Revenue Per Contractor, Customer LTV)
    - Weekly performance dashboard format (Week 1/2/4 targets with tree view)
    - Operational metrics section (real-time monitoring + quality control)
    - Campaign performance table (Facebook Ads + Landing Page)
    - Monthly P&L template
    - Success milestone checklist format (Month 1/2/3)
    - Red/Yellow flag warning indicators
    - Daily monitoring checklist (Morning/Midday/Evening)

    CHANGE for FMM (never use HVAC-specific language):
    - Title: "FMM SUCCESS METRICS & KPI DASHBOARD"
    - Primary KPIs — adjust targets:
      * CPL: Target <$50 (FMM moving leads cost slightly more than HVAC due to lower urgency; moving is planned, not emergency)
      * Lead Quality Score: >80% contractor acceptance rate (same as HVAC)
      * Daily Lead Volume: 10-15 leads/day during peak season (Nov-Apr), 5-8/day off-peak (May-Oct)
      * Form Conversion Rate: >12% (slightly lower than HVAC's 15% — moving is less urgent purchase)
    - Revenue metrics:
      * MRR target: $7,500+ (100 leads/month × $75)
      * Profit Margin: >60% (same structure as HVAC)
      * Average Revenue Per Contractor: $1,125/month (15 leads × $75)
      * Customer LTV: $13,500 (12-month retention × $1,125/month)
    - Weekly targets:
      * Week 1 (Proof of Concept): 15 qualified leads, $50 CPL, 75% acceptance rate, 1 contractor signed
      * Week 2 (Optimization): 25 leads, $45 CPL, 80% acceptance rate, 2 contractors active
      * Week 4 (Scale Ready): 45 leads, $40 CPL, 85% acceptance rate, 3-4 contractors
    - Quality control: Add FMM-specific geographic accuracy (Lee County/Collier County %) and move-date validation (within 30 days)
    - Facebook Ads: Adjust targeting notes — snowbird demographic (homeowners 45-70, Fort Myers/Cape Coral/Naples zip codes), seasonal budget (increase Oct-Apr, reduce May-Sep)
    - Monthly P&L: Adjust to 100 leads × $75 = $7,500 revenue model, $1,200 ad costs, $300 tools, $400 operations = 75%+ margin
    - Milestone checklist: Month 1 = 100+ leads, $7,500+ revenue, 60%+ margin, 2+ contractors; Month 2 = 200+ leads, $15,000+ revenue, 65%+ margin, 4+ contractors; Month 3 = 300+ leads, $22,500+ revenue, 70%+ margin, expansion planning
    - Warning indicators: Red = CPL over $70 for 3+ days; Yellow = CPL $50-70; Red = lead acceptance under 65% (moving leads are harder to verify)
    - Daily monitoring: Add "check snowbird season calendar" in November morning routine; Add contractor invoice status check (moving contractors invoice monthly, not per-job)
    - Add FMM-specific section: "Seasonal Demand Management" — Oct-Apr = peak spend ($80-100/day ads), May-Sep = maintenance spend ($20-30/day ads), note summer spike for local residential moves

    Format: Use same markdown structure and emoji headers as HVAC source. Keep all tables formatted identically.
