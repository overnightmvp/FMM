<objective>
Create two outreach documents adapted from HVAC source: a Fort Myers contractor prospect research file and labor-only moving email templates.

Purpose: FMM needs a concrete prospect list of local moving operators to contact, and ready-to-send email templates for those outreach conversations. Without these, contractor acquisition has no execution path.

Output: docs/contractor-research.md with 10+ real Fort Myers-area moving company prospects and docs/email-templates.md with 5 complete outreach templates (3 primary + 2 follow-up).

  <files>docs/contractor-research.md</files>
  <action>
    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/OMVP-hvac copy/outreach/contractor-research.md first for structural template. Then READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/docs/market-intel.md for Fort Myers market context.

    Create docs/contractor-research.md at /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/docs/contractor-research.md.

    KEEP from HVAC:
    - Tier 1/2/3 prospect classification system
    - Per-prospect format: company name, website, phone, reviews, service area, current marketing, lead generation pain, opportunity score, pitch angle
    - Contact information table with best call times
    - Qualification criteria (green light / red light indicators)
    - Outreach strategy by tier (problem-focused / cost-savings / growth-focused)
    - Next actions section with success metrics

    CHANGE for FMM:
    - Title: "FORT MYERS MOVING CONTRACTOR PROSPECT RESEARCH"
    - All prospects must be Fort Myers / Cape Coral / Naples / Bonita Springs / Estero area moving companies
    - Service type context: "labor-only moving" — contractors provide crew and expertise, not trucks. Focus on movers who do full-service and would benefit from pre-booked labor-only jobs that require no truck overhead.
    - Pain points to identify: Inconsistent weekly demand, competing on Thumbtack/TaskRabbit with 10+ others, can't justify full-time crew during slow months (May-Oct), losing snowbird seasonal work to national platforms
    - Opportunity score criteria: High = local mover 4+ stars, 20-80 reviews, no dedicated landing page, relies on word-of-mouth or Thumbtack
    - Pitch angle focus: "Get pre-qualified moving jobs delivered to you — you bring the expertise and crew, we handle the marketing"

    Create 10 prospect profiles organized as:

    TIER 1 (Perfect Targets — 4 prospects): Small local moving ops, owner-operated, strong local reviews but zero online lead generation. Examples of real Fort Myers/Cape Coral movers to research and document:
    - Include companies like: "Smooth Move Fort Myers," "Cape Coral Moving Company," "Fort Myers Best Movers," "Labor Ready Movers Fort Myers," "Southwest Florida Movers"
    - For each: Document what their website looks like (good/bad), their Thumbtack/Google Business Profile presence, how many reviews, what zip codes they cover
    - Pitch angle: "You're leaving money on the table every week because people searching 'moving help Fort Myers' can't find you."

    TIER 2 (Good Targets — 4 prospects): Established movers using Thumbtack or Angi but paying platform fees, competing with 5+ other contractors per lead. Example companies in Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, or Naples market:
    - For each: Note which platforms they're on, estimated monthly spend, lead competition level
    - Pitch angle: "Stop paying Thumbtack $30-50/lead to compete against 10 others. Get exclusive $75/leads delivered directly to you."

    TIER 3 (Stretch Targets — 2 prospects): Larger established movers who could benefit from overflow lead volume or seasonal capacity filling:
    - For each: Position as "supplemental lead channel during slow months" or "snowbird season overflow"
    - Pitch angle: "Fill your crew's calendar during the summer slow season with pre-qualified local moves."

    Note: If specific company names aren't verifiable, use realistic placeholder names that match the Fort Myers market profile (e.g., "Lee County Movers," "Gulf Coast Moving Services," "Bonita Springs Moving Co.") — clearly mark any unverified with "[RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]"

    Qualification criteria section:
    - Green light: 4.0+ stars, 20+ reviews, serves Lee County or Collier County, minimal web presence or Thumbtack-only marketing, owner-operator or crew of 2-5
    - Red light: National franchise (Two Men and a Truck corporate), full-service with large truck fleet, already has sophisticated digital marketing, bad reviews, outside service area

    Outreach strategy:
    - Tier 1: Problem-focused ("You're invisible online during peak snowbird season")
    - Tier 2: Cost-savings ("Stop splitting Thumbtack leads with competitors")
    - Tier 3: Growth/capacity ("Add 10-15 extra jobs per month during summer without extra marketing spend")

    Success metrics section: Target 30% open rate, 10% response rate, 2-3 demo calls, 1 contractor signed at $1,125/month (15 leads × $75).

    READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/OMVP-hvac copy/outreach/email-templates.md first for structural template. Then READ /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/systems/pricing-guide.md for FMM pricing context.

    Create docs/email-templates.md at /Users/toshioj/Projects/dojjjo/fort-myers-movers/docs/email-templates.md.

    KEEP from HVAC:
    - 3 primary templates + 2 follow-up templates structure
    - Problem-focused / Cost-savings / Competitive advantage template framework
    - Follow-up #1 (48 hours) and Follow-up #2 (1 week / last follow-up) format
    - Email tracking metrics section
    - Best practices and anti-patterns
    - Personalization placeholders [Name], [Company Name]

    CHANGE for FMM (rewrite all body content — do not copy HVAC language):
    - Remove all: AC, HVAC, emergency, summer heat, Arizona, Phoenix references
    - Replace with: moving labor, crew, Fort Myers, snowbird season, Thumbtack/TaskRabbit

    Template 1: Problem-Focused (Tier 1 — invisible local movers)
    - Subject: "Are you losing Fort Myers move jobs to Thumbtack?"
    - Opening hook: "I was looking at moving companies in Fort Myers and noticed something about [Company Name]..."
    - Problem setup: "Your Google reviews are great (4.X stars!), but when someone searches 'moving help Fort Myers' on their phone, you don't show up. That's a problem because 68% of people searching for movers never scroll past the first 3 results."
    - Pain sequence:
      * Homeowner searches "moving help Fort Myers" on phone
      * Finds Thumbtack / TaskRabbit listing with 10+ competing movers
      * Picks whoever responds first or has the lowest price
      * You never even get a chance
    - Solution: "I run a dedicated moving lead generation site for Fort Myers. When someone's ready to move, they fill out a form and I send the lead directly to you — no competition, no bidding wars."
    - Social proof: "Already working for [X] moving companies in Southwest Florida (averaging 12-15 pre-qualified leads per month)"
    - Criteria: SW Florida homeowners, labor-only or full-service within Lee/Collier County, ready to move within 30 days, have furniture/belongings to move (not empty apartment)
    - CTA: "Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Company Name]?"
    - P.S.: "Snowbird season starts in November. The movers who set this up in October always have their best winters."

    Template 2: Cost-Savings Focus (Tier 2 — Thumbtack/Angi users)
    - Subject: "Cut your Thumbtack costs in half (and stop competing for the same leads)"
    - Opening: "Quick question: How much are you paying per lead on Thumbtack or Angi?"
    - Problem: "If you're paying $30-50/lead and competing against 5-10 other movers every time, you're getting a bad deal."
    - Cost comparison: "I send qualified Fort Myers moving leads directly to ONE contractor — no competition. Cost is $75/lead exclusive."
    - How it works: 4-step numbered list (build moving-specific landing page → run ads targeting Fort Myers homeowners ready to move → qualified leads go directly to you → you pay $75 per lead meeting your criteria)
    - Social proof: "Recent results: [Company A] got 18 leads in a month, 14 converted to paid moves. [Company B] fired Thumbtack after their first month."
    - CTA: "Interested in a quick 10-minute call to see if this beats your current lead costs?"
    - P.S.: "One client told me he stopped using Thumbtack after the first week. He's spending less and getting better jobs."

    Template 3: Competitive/Seasonal (Tier 3 — established movers, capacity play)
    - Subject: "How to fill your crew's calendar during the slow season"
    - Opening: "May through October — when snowbirds are gone and residential moves slow down — is when most Fort Myers movers struggle to keep crews busy."
    - Problem: "[Company Name] has a great reputation and strong reviews. But even established movers have dead weeks between jobs during summer."
    - Opportunity: "I generate pre-qualified moving leads for Fort Myers all year. During slow season, I can fill gaps in your schedule — homeowners doing local moves, apartment transitions, small residential jobs."
    - Numbers: "At 10-15 leads/month during slow season × $800-1,200 average job value, that's $8,000-18,000 in additional revenue you wouldn't otherwise have."
    - CTA: "Worth a quick call to talk through whether this fits your operation?"
    - P.S.: "No long-term contracts. You only pay for leads you receive. Stop anytime."

    Follow-Up #1 (48 hours):
    - Subject: "Re: [Original Subject] — 30-second version"
    - Content: Bottom-line summary (3 bullet points): exclusive Fort Myers moving leads, $75/lead, no competition, 10-minute call offer, two suggested time slots

    Follow-Up #2 (1 week — final):
    - Subject: "Last note — snowbird season starting"
    - Content: "This is my last follow-up for [Company Name]. Snowbird season runs November through April — Fort Myers sees 40% more moving activity during those months. The moving companies who get set up with dedicated lead generation in September/October always have their strongest winter seasons. If you want to talk through how this could work, I'm available through [Day]. After that I'll focus on movers who are ready to move forward."
    - P.S.: Specific win from a recent contractor (adjusted for moving)

    Email tracking metrics:
    - Open rate target: 30%+
    - Response rate: 10%+
    - Demo booking rate: 3%+
    - Close rate: 33%+ (1 in 3 demos)

    Best practices: Send Tue-Thu 9am-2pm; personalize [Company Name] and specific moving details; follow up within 48 hours; never follow up more than 3 times; always focus on outcomes (more jobs, less platform dependency) not features (landing page design).

    A/B testing variables: Subject lines (problem vs. seasonal urgency), email length (short 5-line vs. detailed with social proof), CTA placement.
