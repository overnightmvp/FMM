Progress: ███░ 3/4 plans complete (75%)

## Accumulated Decisions

| ID | Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|----|------|----------|-----------|
| D1 | 01-01 | CPL target <$50 (not <$40) | Moving = planned purchase, not emergency service |
| D2 | 01-01 | Peak ad budget Nov-Apr ($80-100/day), maintenance May-Sep ($20-40/day) | Snowbird seasonality dominates Fort Myers market |
| D3 | 01-01 | Season-adjusted lead volume: 10-15/day peak, 5-8/day off-peak | Flat targets misread performance in seasonal market |
| D4 | 01-01 | MRR baseline $7,500 (100 leads × $75) | Conservative baseline for month-1 targets |
| D5 | 01-02 | Tier 1 pitch: search invisibility, not emergency urgency | Moving is not emergency service — HVAC urgency framing doesn't apply |
| D6 | 01-02 | Seasonal urgency: snowbird season (not summer heat) | Fort Myers peak is Nov–Apr — inverted vs Phoenix HVAC source material |
| D7 | 01-02 | Unverifiable contacts marked [RESEARCH NEEDED] | Manual lookup required before outreach; credibility requires verified numbers |
| D8 | 01-02 | Template 3 reframed as slow-season capacity fill | Tier 3 movers have marketing — real pain is dead weeks with crew on payroll |
| D9 | 01-03 | Dashboard uses movers.css tokens (#1e3a8a, #f97316) not HVAC source colors | Consistent with site aesthetic |
| D10 | 01-03 | localStorage keys prefixed fmm-task-N | Avoids collision with other dashboards in workspace |

## Blockers / Concerns

- All Tier 1–2 contractor contact info is [RESEARCH NEEDED] — manual research required before outreach can begin
- Email templates use placeholder social proof ([Company A], [Company B]) — real results needed once first contractor signs
