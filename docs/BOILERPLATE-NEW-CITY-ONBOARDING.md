## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This is a step-by-step replication guide. Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] markers with city-specific values. Cross-references to FMM docs indicate which templates to copy and adapt. Do not start Section 2 until Section 1's Go/No-Go decision is complete.

**Variable Glossary:**
- **[CITY_NAME]** — Replace with target city (e.g., "Charlotte")
- **[CITY_STATE]** — Replace with state abbreviation (e.g., "NC")
- **[METRO_AREA]** — Replace with broader metro description (e.g., "Charlotte, Concord, Gastonia")
- **[AREA_CODE]** — Replace with local area code (e.g., "704")
- **[PEAK_MONTHS]** — Replace with local peak moving season (e.g., "April-June, August-September" for Charlotte)
- **[SNOWBIRD_MARKET]** — YES or NO (Fort Myers = YES; Charlotte, Austin = NO)
- **[SERVICE_RADIUS]** — Replace with mile radius defining service area (e.g., "40")
- **[TARGET_COUNTIES]** — Replace with counties in service area (e.g., "Mecklenburg, Union, Cabarrus")
- **[DOMAIN]** — Replace with chosen domain (e.g., "charlotte-labor-movers.com")

**One rule before you start:** Do not work on Section 2 until you have a GO decision from Section 1's scorecard. Skipping the market research step is the single most common mistake in launching a new city. The scorecard takes 2 hours and saves 2 weeks of wasted setup work.

## SECTION 1: PRE-LAUNCH RESEARCH (Days 1-2)
### "Is [CITY_NAME] a Go?"

### 1.1 Market Sizing Worksheet

Fill in this table before making any technical commitments.

| Variable | Formula | Fort Myers Benchmark | [CITY_NAME] |
|----------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Metro Population | — | 800,000 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Homeownership Rate (%) | Census data | 67% | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Annual Move Rate (%) | Local estimate | 18% (FL high-growth) | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Total Annual Moves | Population × Homeownership% × Move Rate% | ~96,480 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Target Market Share | 5% of annual moves | 5% | 5% |
| Addressable Leads/Year | Total Moves × 5% | ~4,824 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Leads/Month at Target | Addressable/12 | ~402 | [PLACEHOLDER] |

**Formula:** Population × Homeownership% × Move Rate% × 5% market share ÷ 12 = Monthly lead target

**Go threshold:** Monthly addressable leads > 150. Below 150 = market too small, skip city.

**National benchmarks for move rate:**
- Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee: 14-18% (high-growth states)
- Midwest / Northeast: 10-12% (lower mobility)
- National average: 12%

### 1.2 Competitor Analysis Template

Research each row before scoring the market.

| Competitor Type | Fort Myers Baseline | [CITY_NAME] Research |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Thumbtack (# of moving contractors listed) | ~15-20 | [PLACEHOLDER — search "labor movers [CITY_NAME]" on thumbtack.com] |
| Angi / HomeAdvisor contractors | ~10-15 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Local Facebook moving groups (member count) | 3-5 groups, 2K-8K members | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Local aggregators (MoversDirect, etc.) | None dominant | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| National franchise movers (Two Men, College Hunks) | 2-3 franchise locations | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Our advantage | Exclusive leads, snowbird targeting, mobile-first | [PLACEHOLDER — what's the local gap?] |

**Thumbtack saturation guide:**
- Fewer than 20 contractors listed = underserved market = strong opportunity
- 20-30 contractors listed = normal competition = viable entry
- 30-50 contractors listed = crowded market = harder but possible
- 50+ contractors listed = saturated = reconsider or find niche angle

---

### 1.3 Seasonal Demand Profile

**[SNOWBIRD_MARKET] = YES (Fort Myers, Naples, Sarasota, Southwest FL coastal markets):**
Use Fort Myers model. Peak is November-April (snowbird arrivals and departures). Secondary June-August (summer relocations). Maintenance budget July-October.

| Period | Demand Level | Ad Budget | Strategy |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| October | Rising | $40-50/day | Launch, sign contractors |
| Nov-Apr | PEAK | $80-100/day | Maximum spend |
| May-Jun | High | $50-60/day | Summer moves |
| Jul-Aug | Moderate | $30-40/day | Maintain |
| Sep | Variable | Surge if storm | Hurricane recovery |

**[SNOWBIRD_MARKET] = NO (Charlotte, Austin, Nashville, most non-coastal markets):**
Standard seasonality — school-year transitions drive moves.

| Period | Demand Level | Ad Budget |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Jan-Feb | Low | $20-30/day |
| Mar-Apr | Rising | $40-50/day |
| May-Jun | PEAK (school year end) | $70-90/day |
| Jul-Aug | High | $60-80/day |
| Sep-Oct | Moderate | $40-50/day |
| Nov-Dec | Low | $20-30/day |

**Special market notes:**
- Cities with large military bases (Jacksonville FL, San Antonio TX, Hampton Roads VA, Fayetteville NC): Military family moves add ~15-20% stable year-round demand — include military-specific ad copy and consider year-round moderate budget rather than deep seasonal cuts.
- College towns with large universities (Austin, Nashville, Charlotte metro): August/January move surges tied to academic calendar — plan surge budgets $100-120/day in those specific weeks.

**[CITY_NAME] seasonal calendar:**
- Peak months: [PEAK_MONTHS]
- Peak daily ad budget: $[PLACEHOLDER]/day
- Off-peak daily ad budget: $[PLACEHOLDER]/day

---

### 1.4 Lead Qualification Criteria (Customize Per City)

**Universal criteria — never change:**
- Ready to move within 30 days
- 2+ bedroom minimum (smaller jobs aren't worth $75/lead to contractors)
- Labor-only service area (no truck provided — contractor brings crew)
- Valid phone number reachable within 24 hours
- No duplicate (same customer within 30 days)

**Geographic criteria — customize per city:**
- Fort Myers: Lee County + north Collier County (within 50-mile radius of Fort Myers)
- [CITY_NAME]: [METRO_AREA] within [SERVICE_RADIUS]-mile radius — define this before launching ads
- Define the exact zip codes in your service area and add them to the Facebook ad geo-targeting before spending a dollar

**Seasonal criteria — snowbird markets only:**
- Include: "Moving into seasonal residence"
- Include: "Moving out of seasonal residence"
- Do NOT include: Long-distance moves (60+ miles) — these require trucks we don't supply

**[CITY_NAME] qualification criteria:**
- Geographic: [METRO_AREA], [SERVICE_RADIUS]-mile radius
- Target counties: [TARGET_COUNTIES]
- Property types: Single-family, townhome, apartment (2+ bedrooms)
- Move urgency: Within 30 days
- Snowbird add-on (if applicable): [YES/NO]

---

### 1.5 Pricing Validation

Research what local movers pay on Thumbtack/Angi/HomeAdvisor in this specific market before confirming $75/lead pricing.

**Research process (15 minutes):**
1. Create a free contractor account on Thumbtack — search "labor movers [CITY_NAME]" to see estimated lead costs
2. Check Angi Pro pricing for moving lead packages in [CITY_NAME]
3. Google "moving leads [CITY_NAME]" — see what aggregators charge

**Pricing decision framework:**
- Our price ($75) should be equal to or less than what contractors currently pay per lead, OR
- We offer exclusive delivery, which justifies paying up to 2x current platform price

**ROI check for contractor pitch:**
- $75 lead × contractor average job value ($800-1,500 Fort Myers) = 10-20x ROI
- If market has lower average job values (smaller apartments, college towns), consider $50/lead pricing

**[CITY_NAME] pricing research:**
| Platform | Lead Cost | Exclusivity | Close Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Thumbtack | $[PLACEHOLDER] | Shared (5-10 movers) | ~15% | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Angi | $[PLACEHOLDER] | Shared (3-5 movers) | ~20% | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Our offer | $75 | Exclusive | ~65% | [PLACEHOLDER] |

**Recommended pricing for [CITY_NAME]:** $[PLACEHOLDER]/lead

---

### 1.6 Go/No-Go Scorecard

Score each item and total at the bottom. Be honest — a failed city launch wastes 2-3 weeks and $300-500 in ad spend.

| Criterion | Score | [CITY_NAME] Result |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Metro population > 500K | +2 | [YES/NO] |
| Monthly addressable leads > 150 | +2 | [YES/NO] |
| Homeownership rate > 55% | +1 | [YES/NO] |
| Thumbtack has < 30 contractors listed | +2 | [YES/NO] |
| No dominant local lead aggregator | +1 | [YES/NO] |
| 10+ local moving companies on Google Maps | +1 | [YES/NO] |
| Average contractor reviews < 4.3/5 (room to help quality operators stand out) | +1 | [YES/NO] |
| **TOTAL** | **/10** | **[PLACEHOLDER]** |

**Decision rules:**
- Score 7-10: **GO** — proceed to Section 2 immediately
- Score 5-6: **HOLD** — reassess in 90 days, or identify specific gap to close
- Score < 5: **NO GO** — this city doesn't fit the model today

**[CITY_NAME] Go/No-Go Decision:** [GO / HOLD / NO GO]
**Score:** [X]/10
**Notes:** [PLACEHOLDER — key factors driving decision]

**Do not proceed to Section 2 if score < 7.**

- [ ] Formspree email routing confirmed

---

## SECTION 3: CONTRACTOR ACQUISITION (Days 6-10)
### "Finding and Signing Your First Contractor in [CITY_NAME]"

**Reference doc:** `docs/contractor-research.md` — Fort Myers prospect list with tier system and pitch angles. Use this as your template. Same structure, [CITY_NAME] content.

---

### 3.1 Prospect Research Process

**Goal:** 10+ qualified contractor prospects in your prospect file before first outreach email.

**Step-by-step (90 minutes total):**

1. Google Maps (30 min): Search "moving company [CITY_NAME]" → open top 20 results in separate tabs
2. Filter criteria (apply immediately):
   - Locally owned (not Two Men and a Truck corporate — franchise owner still qualifies)
   - 4.0+ Google stars
   - 20+ reviews (enough history to trust)
   - Serves [TARGET_COUNTIES] / [METRO_AREA]
3. For each passing the filter, note: company name, phone, website quality (good/bad/none), Thumbtack/Angi presence (yes/no)
4. Thumbtack search (15 min): Search "labor movers [CITY_NAME]" — note which of your Google Maps prospects appear, which don't (non-Thumbtack = Tier 1 target)
5. Angi search (15 min): Same process
6. Document in your [CITY_NAME] contractor research file (copy structure from `docs/contractor-research.md`)

**Tier classification:**

| Tier | Profile | Fort Myers Examples | Pitch Approach |
|------|---------|--------------------|-|
| **Tier 1** | Owner-operated, 1-3 trucks, 4+ stars, no online lead gen | Lee County Movers, Smooth Move Fort Myers | Problem-focused: "You're invisible online" |
| **Tier 2** | Medium size, using Thumbtack/Angi — paying platform fees | Gulf Coast Moving, Bonita Springs Moving Co. | Cost-savings: "You're sharing leads with 10 competitors" |
| **Tier 3** | Established movers with solid marketing, need overflow volume | Two Men and a Truck, All My Sons | Capacity: "Fill dead weeks in your slow season" |

**Best first targets:** Tier 1 movers who respond to Thumbtack/Angi requests (they already pay for leads) but hate the bidding model. They understand the value of leads — they just want a better deal.

**[CITY_NAME] Tier 1 Targets (fill in):**

| # | Company | Phone | Stars/Reviews | Current Marketing | Opportunity Score | Pitch Angle |
|---|---------|-------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [X]/10 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| 2 | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [X]/10 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| 3 | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [X]/10 | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| 4 | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [X]/10 | [PLACEHOLDER] |

---

### 3.2 Outreach Execution

**Reference doc:** `docs/email-templates.md` — Fort Myers outreach templates (3 primary + 2 follow-ups). These are your copy base. The structure is proven. Customize city references only.

**Template customization checklist per email sent:**
- [ ] Replace "Fort Myers" with "[CITY_NAME]"
- [ ] Replace "Southwest Florida" / "Lee County" with "[METRO_AREA]" / "[TARGET_COUNTIES]"
- [ ] Replace snowbird references with [PEAK_MONTHS] references (or remove if no snowbird market)
- [ ] Verify the company's actual Thumbtack/Angi presence before calling it out
- [ ] Look up their actual Google star rating — never estimate in the email
- [ ] Use the owner's name (call the business if needed — "Hi, I'm looking for the owner to discuss a partnership")

**Sending schedule:**
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 9am-2pm local time ([CITY_STATE])
- Sequence: Template → wait 48 hours → Follow-Up #1 → wait 1 week → Follow-Up #2 → done
- Never follow up more than 3 times total

**[CITY_NAME] outreach pipeline:**

| Company | Tier | Template | Sent Date | FU1 Date | FU2 Date | Status |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| [PLACEHOLDER] | [1/2/3] | [1/2/3] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] |

---

### 3.3 Demo Call Script

**Call opening (first 60 seconds):**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] — I run a moving lead generation site targeting [CITY_NAME] homeowners. I sent you an email a few days ago about exclusive moving leads. Do you have 10 minutes to talk through how it works?"

**Qualify before pitching:**
> "Before I get into the details — what does your current lead flow look like? Are you using Thumbtack, Angi, Google Ads, or mostly word-of-mouth right now?"

Listen for: pain with shared leads, slow season gaps, dependence on referrals. Match your pitch to what they say.

**The pitch (after qualifying):**
> "Here's what we do: I run ads targeting [CITY_NAME] homeowners who need labor-only moving help. When someone fills out a form, that lead goes exclusively to you — no other movers competing for the same job. The lead fee is $75 per qualified lead. That means someone who's ready to move within 30 days, in [TARGET_COUNTIES], 2+ bedrooms."

**The ROI close:**
> "Let me show you the math. A typical [CITY_NAME] labor-only move is [$800-1,200]. If you close 65% of the leads we send — which is what contractors typically see with exclusive leads — that's [$520-780] revenue per $75 lead. That's a 7-10x return. Does that pencil out for your business?"

**Payment setup close:**
> "I like to start with a 10-lead trial — no commitment, no setup fee. We send 10 leads, you pay $750, and you see firsthand what the quality looks like. If you don't want to continue after that, you don't have to. But most contractors keep going. Want to get started this week before [PEAK_MONTHS] kicks in?"

---

### 3.4 Contractor Onboarding Checklist

Complete before routing any leads to a contractor.

- [ ] Signed lead purchase agreement (price, definition of qualified lead, dispute process)

---

## SECTION 4: CAMPAIGN LAUNCH (Week 2)
### "Running Facebook Ads in [CITY_NAME]"

**Reference doc:** `systems/success-metrics.md` — all KPI targets, campaign benchmarks, and daily monitoring checklists. Use directly for [CITY_NAME] with adjusted seasonal calendar.

---

### 4.1 Facebook Campaign Setup

**Business Manager:**
1. Log into business.facebook.com
2. Create new Ad Account for [CITY_NAME] (separate from Fort Myers — cleaner reporting)
3. Connect your payment method

**Campaign settings:**
- Objective: Leads (Meta Lead Ads) OR Traffic to landing page — test both, leads objective usually wins for moving
- Campaign name: "[CITY_NAME] Moving Leads — [Month Year]"

**Audience targeting:**
- Age: 35-65 (homeowners with furniture)
- Homeownership: Target "Likely Homeowners" if available in your market
- Location: [METRO_AREA] — target by zip codes, not just city name (more precise)
- Interests: Moving, HomeAdvisor, Real Estate, Relocation
- Behaviors: "Recently Moved" (exclude — they already moved) vs. "Likely to Move" (include)

**Starting budget:**
- Days 1-3: $30/day (data gathering, don't optimize yet)
- Days 4-7: Adjust to top performers, pause poor ad sets
- Week 2+: Scale winners to $[PLACEHOLDER]/day based on Section 1.3 seasonal calendar

---

### 4.2 Ad Creative Guidelines

**What works for moving ads:**

Headline formula: "[Location] [Pain Point] → [Our Solution]"
- "Need Help Moving in [CITY_NAME]? We Send the Crew."
- "Labor-Only Movers in [CITY_NAME] — No Truck Needed"
- "[CITY_NAME] Moving Crew — Book Online, Same Week"

Body copy formula: Urgency → Feature → Proof → CTA
- Bad: "We offer labor-only moving services in [CITY_NAME]."
- Good: "Moving this month? [CITY_NAME] moving crew handles loading, unloading, and heavy lifting. You rent the truck. We do the work. Starting at $300. Same-week availability."

**Snowbird market seasonal copy (add to rotation Oct-Apr):**
- "Arriving for season? [CITY_NAME] Moving Crew — Same Week Availability"
- "Closing Up? We Handle the Heavy Lifting Before You Head North"

**General market seasonal copy ([PEAK_MONTHS] surge):**
- "Moving this [season]? [CITY_NAME] Labor Crew — Book Online in 60 Seconds"
- "Summer move? [CITY_NAME] moving help — no truck required"

**Image guidance:**
- Crew in action (real local photos > stock photos)
- Local landmark or neighborhood photo for trust
- Before/after loaded truck
- Avoid: sad/stressed people, empty rooms without context

---

### 4.3 Lead Quality Control

**Before routing to contractor, verify:**
- [ ] Phone number has [AREA_CODE] or adjacent area code (not clearly out of area)
- [ ] Move date is within 30 days
- [ ] Home size is 2+ bedrooms (ask if not on form)
- [ ] Location is within [SERVICE_RADIUS]-mile radius of [CITY_NAME]
- [ ] Not a duplicate (check last 30 days)

**Automatic reject criteria:**
- Phone disconnected or Google Voice (common spam signal)
- Move date is more than 60 days out
- Address outside [TARGET_COUNTIES] service area
- Identical name/phone to submission within 30 days

**Reference:** Full quality criteria documented in `systems/success-metrics.md` Quality Control Metrics section.

---

### 4.4 First Week Optimization Protocol

**Daily 10-minute check (9am each morning):**
1. Log into Facebook Ads Manager
2. Check: CPL trend (target <$50), lead volume (target per Section 1.3 calendar), CTR (target >1.5%)
3. If CPL > $70 for 2+ days → pause worst ad set, shift budget to winner
4. If CTR < 1% → swap ad creative (try new headline or image)
5. Note best-performing ad set → scale by 20% (never double overnight)

**First week KPI targets:**
- 15+ qualified leads generated
- CPL < $50
- 75%+ contractor acceptance rate
- 1 contractor signed and active

**Reference:** Full weekly targets in `systems/success-metrics.md` Weekly Performance Dashboard.

---

## SECTION 5: OPERATIONS & SCALING (Week 3+)
### "Running the [CITY_NAME] Business Day-to-Day"

**Reference docs:** `systems/success-metrics.md` (KPI tracking rhythm) and `systems/lead-routing-setup.md` (Zapier automation). Both apply directly to [CITY_NAME] — no modification needed beyond city-name swaps.

---

### 5.1 Lead Tracking Setup

**Google Sheets structure (create one sheet per city):**

| Column | Field | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A | Lead Date | Auto-fill from Zapier |
| B | Name | From form |
| C | Phone | From form |
| D | Move Date | From form |
| E | Home Size | From form |
| F | Location | From form |
| G | Contractor Assigned | Your routing assignment |
| H | Lead Status | New / Sent / Accepted / Rejected |
| I | Rejection Reason | If rejected — fill in quality issue |
| J | Invoice Month | For billing |
| K | Invoice # | Stripe/Wave invoice number |

**One sheet per contractor** — separate tab in the same Google Sheet. Makes invoicing easy: filter by contractor and month.

---

### 5.2 Zapier Automation

**Trigger:** New Formspree submission → Google Sheets row added → SMS to you → SMS to contractor

**Setup (uses Zapier free tier for basic flow):**
1. Zap 1: Formspree → Google Sheets (log every submission automatically)
2. Zap 2: Google Sheets new row → Twilio SMS to your phone (instant alert)
3. Zap 3 (Phase 2, when contractor is trusted): Google Sheets new row → Twilio SMS directly to contractor (removes you from routing loop)

**SMS template for contractor:**
> "New [CITY_NAME] moving lead — [Name], [Phone], Move date: [Date], Location: [Address/Area]. Reply ACCEPT or REJECT."

**Reference:** Full 3-phase automation setup in `systems/lead-routing-setup.md`.

---

### 5.3 Invoicing Process

**Invoice tool:** Wave (wave.com) — free invoicing software.

**Monthly invoicing process:**
1. Last day of month: Count accepted leads per contractor from Google Sheets
2. Create invoice in Wave: "[CITY_NAME] Moving Leads — [Month]" — [X leads × $75 = $Y]
3. Send via Wave (email delivery) — note invoice number in Google Sheets
4. Terms: Net 15 from invoice date
5. If unpaid at Day 16: pause lead delivery, email contractor
6. If unpaid at Day 30: suspend contractor access, hold leads until cleared

**Dispute resolution:**
- Contractor claims lead was invalid: Review original form submission and call log
- If contractor is right (fake number, wrong area): Credit to next invoice
- If contractor is wrong: Explain criteria, do not credit (sets precedent)
- Criteria for credit: Phone disconnected or unreachable after 3 attempts in 24 hours, address outside [TARGET_COUNTIES], duplicate within 30 days

---

### 5.4 KPI Tracking Rhythm

**Reference:** `systems/success-metrics.md` Daily Monitoring Checklist — use this directly for [CITY_NAME]. The only change is substituting [CITY_NAME] seasonal calendar for Fort Myers snowbird calendar.

**Daily (5 minutes, 9am):**
- Leads generated yesterday
- Current CPL vs target (<$50)
- Campaign status (active, budgets not exhausted)
- Any lead quality issues to review

**Weekly (30 minutes, Monday morning):**
- Week-over-week lead volume comparison
- CPL trend
- Contractor acceptance rate
- Any contractor feedback or quality complaints

**Monthly (1 hour, first Monday):**
- Full P&L review
- Invoice reconciliation
- Contractor performance by volume
- Seasonal budget adjustment for next month
- Expansion opportunity assessment

**[CITY_NAME] KPI targets (align with Fort Myers benchmarks unless local research shows different):**

| Metric | Fort Myers Target | [CITY_NAME] Target |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| CPL | <$50 | $[PLACEHOLDER] |

### 5.5 Contractor Retention

**First 30 days — high-touch onboarding:**
- Day 5: Check-in call — "How was the first week's leads? Any quality concerns?"
- Day 10: Quick text — "How many of last week's leads converted to jobs?"
- Day 20: Email — share any optimization adjustments you made based on their feedback
- Day 30: Monthly review call — lead quality, volume, any issues, renewal commitment

**Churn prevention signals (act immediately if you see these):**
- Contractor stops responding to lead delivery texts
- Acceptance rate drops below 65% (they're rejecting borderline leads = they're losing faith)
- Missed invoice payment after Day 15
- Contractor mentions Thumbtack or Angi in conversation

**Churn prevention response:**
- One phone call, not email — real conversation about what's wrong
- Offer a quality credit if there's been a bad batch
- Remind them of the ROI math (review their close rate on your leads vs. platform close rate)

## SECTION 6: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION (Month 2+)
### "Scaling to [CITY_NAME] 2 and Beyond"

---

### 6.1 When to Expand to City 2

Do not start a second city until these conditions are met in [CITY_NAME]:

- [ ] 90+ days operating in [CITY_NAME]
- [ ] 100+ leads/month generated consistently (2+ consecutive months)
- [ ] 2+ active contractors (reduces single-contractor risk)
- [ ] CPL stable at <$50
- [ ] Lead acceptance rate >80% (quality system proven)
- [ ] $7,500/month revenue run rate achieved
- [ ] Zapier automation running (leads route without your daily involvement)
- [ ] Monthly operations require <10 hours/week (system is running itself)

**Why this matters:** Starting city 2 before city 1 is stable is the most common failure mode. Two underfunded, understaffed cities = two broken systems. One optimized city = proof of concept. Then build city 2 from a position of strength.

---

### 6.2 City Selection Framework

**Priority expansion cities and rationale:**

| City | Population | Move Rate | Snowbird | Military | Score |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Tampa, FL** | 3.2M metro | 16% (FL growth) | Partial (coastal) | No major base | 9/10 |
| **Charlotte, NC** | 2.7M metro | 15% (NC growth) | No | No | 8/10 |
| **Austin, TX** | 2.3M metro | 18% (TX growth) | No | No | 8/10 |
| **Nashville, TN** | 2.1M metro | 15% (TN growth) | No | No | 7/10 |

**Tampa first because:**
- Same state — Florida contractor licensing knowledge transfers
- Partial snowbird market (coastal) — seasonal expertise partially transfers
- Overlapping metro with Fort Myers (some contractors may have Tampa crews)
- Large, fast-growing market with proven demand

**Charlotte second because:**
- No snowbird complexity — simpler seasonal model
- Southeast hub with high in-migration (from NY/NJ/IL)
- Strong homeownership culture (suburban metro)
- Fewer national competitors than Austin or Nashville

**[NEXT_CITY] selection:**
- City: [PLACEHOLDER]
- Rationale: [PLACEHOLDER]
- Go/No-Go research date: [PLACEHOLDER]

### 6.3 What Transfers Directly (Zero Modification)

These assets copy to every new city with only variable substitution:

| Asset | Transfer Method | Time Required |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Landing page (index.html) | Find/replace 6 variables (Section 2.1) | 30 minutes |
| Email templates (3 primary + 2 follow-up) | Swap city name + seasonal references | 45 minutes |
| Contractor research process + tier system | `docs/contractor-research.md` as template | Structure transfers, content needs city research |
| Zapier automation flows | Duplicate and reconnect to new Formspree endpoint | 1 hour |
| Success metrics KPIs | `systems/success-metrics.md` targets apply | 0 minutes |
| Google Sheets lead tracker | Duplicate sheet, rename for new city | 15 minutes |
| Invoicing process | Same Wave process, new contractor records | 0 minutes |

---

### 6.4 What Requires Customization Per City

| Asset | What Changes | Time Required |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Seasonal ad calendar | Peak months, budget schedule | 30 minutes |
| Service area zip codes | Define new radius/counties | 30 minutes |
| Competitor analysis | New market research | 2 hours |
| Contractor prospect list | Full research required | 3-4 hours |
| Ad targeting geo | New zip code list | 15 minutes |

| GA4 property | New property for city | 15 minutes |
| Formspree form | New form, new endpoint | 15 minutes |
| Domain | New city domain (~$10) | 10 minutes |

**Total customization time for city 2+:** 8-12 hours (vs. 40+ hours for a from-scratch launch)
