## Template 1: Problem-Focused (Tier 1 Prospects)

**Who:** Small owner-operated movers with good Google reviews but no dedicated online lead gen. They're invisible to mobile searchers.

**Subject**: Are you losing Fort Myers move jobs to Thumbtack?

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I was looking at moving companies in Fort Myers and noticed something about [Company Name]...

Your Google reviews are great — [X] stars. But when someone searches "moving help Fort Myers" on their phone right now, you don't show up. That's a problem because 68% of people searching for movers never scroll past the first 3 results.

Here's what's happening every week:

• Homeowner in Fort Myers needs help with a move
• Searches "moving help Fort Myers" on their phone
• Finds a Thumbtack or TaskRabbit page with 10+ competing movers
• Picks whoever responds first or charges the least
• You never even get a chance

I run a dedicated moving lead generation site for Fort Myers. When someone's ready to move, they fill out a form and I send the lead directly to you — no competition, no bidding wars.

I'm already working with moving companies in Southwest Florida, averaging 12–15 pre-qualified leads per month each. The leads I send are:

✓ Southwest Florida homeowners (Fort Myers / Cape Coral / Naples / Bonita Springs)
✓ Labor-only or full-service moves within Lee or Collier County
✓ Ready to move within 30 days — not just browsing
✓ Have furniture and belongings to move (not an empty apartment)

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Snowbird season starts in November. The movers who get set up with dedicated lead generation in October always have their best winters. The ones who wait are still thinking about it when December comes.

## Template 2: Cost-Savings Focus (Tier 2 Prospects)

**Who:** Moving companies already using Thumbtack, Angi, or TaskRabbit — paying platform fees and competing against multiple other contractors for every lead.

**Subject**: Cut your Thumbtack costs in half (and stop competing for the same leads)

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much are you paying per lead on Thumbtack or Angi?

If you're paying $30–50 per lead and competing against 5–10 other movers every time, you're getting a bad deal.

Here's the math: At $40/lead on Thumbtack, competing against 8 other contractors, your actual cost per booked job is more like $200–400 once you factor in the leads that don't respond or go with someone else.

I send qualified Fort Myers moving leads directly to ONE contractor — no competition, no bidding wars. Cost is $75 per exclusive lead.

Here's how it works:
1. I build a moving-specific landing page targeting Fort Myers homeowners
2. I run targeted ads to people actively searching for movers in Fort Myers / Cape Coral / Naples
3. Qualified leads go directly to you — no platform taking a cut, no other contractors competing
4. You pay $75 per lead that meets your criteria (valid phone, move within 30 days, in your service area)

Recent results:
• [Company A] got 18 exclusive Fort Myers leads in a month — 14 converted to paid moves
• [Company B] stopped using Thumbtack after their first month with us. Same budget, no competition.

The leads convert better because the homeowner found you first — they're not comparing you against 10 others on a platform listing.

Interested in a quick 10-minute call to see if this beats your current lead costs for [Company Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. One client told me he stopped using Thumbtack after his first week. He said he was spending less and getting better jobs — no more racing to respond before someone else.

## Template 3: Seasonal / Capacity Focus (Tier 3 Prospects)

**Who:** Larger established movers with solid marketing who still have dead weeks May–October when snowbirds leave and residential moves slow down.

**Subject**: How to fill your crew's calendar during the slow season

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

May through October — when snowbirds are gone and residential moves slow down — is when most Fort Myers movers struggle to keep crews busy.

[Company Name] has a great reputation and strong reviews. But even established movers have dead weeks between jobs during summer. Your crew is still on payroll. The trucks are still parked. The work just isn't there.

I generate pre-qualified moving leads for Fort Myers all year. During the slow season, I can fill gaps in your schedule — homeowners doing local moves, apartment transitions, small residential jobs that don't require your full operation.

The math works in your favor:
• 10–15 leads per month during slow season
• Average labor-only job value: $800–$1,200
• That's $8,000–$18,000 in additional revenue during the months you'd otherwise be slow

These aren't full-service hauls competing with your main business. They're pre-qualified labor-only moves — customers who have their own truck or rental and just need a reliable crew. Show up, do the work, collect payment, move on.

Worth a quick 10-minute call to see if this fits your operation?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. No long-term contracts. You only pay for leads you receive. If you get 10 leads and decide it's not for you, stop anytime. Most contractors keep going because the numbers work.

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up #1 (48 hours after original send)

**When to use:** No response to any of Templates 1–3 after 48 hours. One follow-up only at this stage.

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject] — 30-second version

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Sent you a note about Fort Myers moving leads a couple days ago — not sure if you had a chance to see it.

Here's the short version:

• I send exclusive Fort Myers moving leads directly to you — no Thumbtack, no platform fees, no competing against other movers
• $75 per qualified lead (Fort Myers / Cape Coral / Naples area, ready to move within 30 days)
• You only pay for leads you receive — no setup fees, no monthly minimums

Worth a 10-minute conversation? I'm free Tuesday 10–11am or Thursday 2–3pm — happy to find a time that works for you.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (1 week after original send — final)

**When to use:** No response after original email and Follow-Up #1. This is the last contact. Do not follow up after this.

**Subject**: Last note — snowbird season starting

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

This is my last follow-up for [Company Name].

Snowbird season runs November through April — Fort Myers sees 40% more moving activity during those months. Arrivals in October, departures in April, and year-round relocations in between. The moving companies who get set up with dedicated lead generation in September and October always have their strongest winter seasons.

If you want to talk through how this could work for [Company Name], I'm available through [Day]. After that, I'll focus on movers who are ready to move forward.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Last month, one of the Fort Myers contractors I work with told me October was his best month ever — 16 pre-qualified jobs, crew fully booked every week. He'd been relying on Thumbtack for 2 years before that. First month we worked together, he stopped renewing his Thumbtack membership.

## Email Tracking and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Open Rate | 30%+ | Subject line test: problem vs. seasonal urgency |
| Response Rate | 10%+ | 1 response per 10 outreach emails sent |
| Demo Booking Rate | 3%+ | Response → scheduled call |
| Close Rate | 33%+ | 1 in 3 demo calls → signed contractor |

### Pipeline Math (to hit $1,125/month from first contractor):
- Send 30 outreach emails → 9 opens → 3 responses → 1 demo call → 0.33 close
- Need 30–40 outreach emails to get first signed contractor (15 leads × $75 = $1,125/month)

---

## Best Practices

### Send timing:
- Best: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday — 9am to 2pm local (EST)
- Avoid: Monday mornings (buried in weekend catchup), Friday afternoons (checked out)

### Personalization requirements (non-negotiable):
- [Name] — use actual owner/operator name, not "Hi there" or "Hi [Company Name]"
- [Company Name] — appears at least once in every template
- Star rating reference in Template 1 — look up their actual Google rating before sending
- Platform reference in Template 2 — verify they're actually on Thumbtack/Angi before calling it out

### Sequence rules:
- Wait 48 hours before Follow-Up #1
- Wait 1 week after Follow-Up #1 before sending Follow-Up #2
- Never follow up more than 3 times total (Original + FU1 + FU2)
- If they respond "not interested" — thank them and stop immediately

### Anti-patterns:
- Never lead with features (landing page design, ad strategy) — lead with outcomes (more jobs, less platform dependency)
- Never mention price in the subject line
- Never use generic templates without verifying their specific platform/pain point
- Never pitch Tier 3 prospects on the same problem-focused angle as Tier 1 — they know what lead gen is

## A/B Testing Variables

Track these variations to improve response rates over time:

| Variable | Version A | Version B |
|---|---|---|
| Template 1 subject | "Are you losing Fort Myers move jobs to Thumbtack?" | "Why movers in Fort Myers can't find [Company Name] online" |
| Template 2 subject | "Cut your Thumbtack costs in half" | "Stop competing with 10 movers for the same Fort Myers job" |
| Follow-Up #1 length | 3-bullet short version (current) | Single paragraph + single CTA |
| Social proof type | Specific lead count (18 leads/month) | Revenue outcome ($8K–$18K slow season) |
| CTA position | End of email (current) | After pain sequence (before solution) |

**Track per template:** Open rate, response rate, positive response rate (interested vs. unsubscribe)
