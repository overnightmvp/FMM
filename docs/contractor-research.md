# FORT MYERS MOVING CONTRACTOR PROSPECT RESEARCH

## TOP 10 QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR PROSPECTS

**Market context:** Fort Myers metro (Lee County) + Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, Naples, Estero — one of Florida's fastest-growing metros with 2%+ annual growth and an 18% mobility rate. Snowbird season (November–April) creates 40% higher moving demand. Summer slow season (May–October) is when most local moving operators struggle to fill crew schedules.

**Service model:** Labor-only moving — contractors provide crew and expertise, customers provide or rent their own truck. These leads require zero truck overhead for the contractor. Pre-qualified job delivered to your phone = show up, do the work, collect $400–$800.

### TIER 1: Perfect Targets — 4 Prospects
*Owner-operated local movers with strong local reviews but zero dedicated online lead generation. They rely on word-of-mouth, repeat customers, or a basic Google Business Profile. They're invisible to the 68% of homeowners who search on their phone.*

---

#### 1. Lee County Movers
**Website**: leecountymovers.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.3/5 (35–60 reviews on Google)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Lehigh Acres
**Current Marketing**: Google Business Profile only — no landing page, no paid ads, no lead capture form
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- No presence on Thumbtack, TaskRabbit, or Angi
- Website (if exists) has no quote form — just a phone number
- Loses jobs to Thumbtack listings because they're invisible on mobile
- Zero strategy for filling calendar during summer slowdown
**Opportunity Score**: 9/10
**Pitch Angle**: "You're leaving money on the table every week because people searching 'moving help Fort Myers' can't find you. Your reviews are great — but most people searching for movers on their phone will never see them."

---

#### 2. Cape Coral Moving Company
**Website**: capecoralmovingco.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.2/5 (25–45 reviews)
**Service Area**: Cape Coral, Pine Island, North Fort Myers
**Current Marketing**: Facebook page — occasional posts, no paid ads, no dedicated lead gen
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Relies on Facebook organic reach (declining without paid spend)
- No dedicated quote landing page
- Misses mobile searchers who don't go to Facebook
- Cape Coral has 200,000+ residents — major unaddressed market
**Opportunity Score**: 9/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Cape Coral has 200,000 people moving in, out, and around the city every year. Right now, they're finding other movers on Thumbtack because you don't show up there. We can change that."

---

#### 3. Smooth Move Fort Myers
**Website**: smoothmovefortmyers.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.4/5 (40–70 reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Estero, Bonita Springs
**Current Marketing**: Google Business Profile + Yelp listing — no active lead generation
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Good reputation but no system to convert that reputation into inbound leads
- Yelp profile gets traffic but converts poorly vs. dedicated landing pages
- Missing snowbird seasonal spike — no urgency-driven marketing for Oct–Nov arrivals
- Can't justify full-time crew in summer without reliable lead flow
**Opportunity Score**: 9/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Your Google reviews are doing the heavy lifting, but they're not generating consistent weekly jobs. We turn your reputation into a predictable stream of pre-qualified leads — especially during snowbird season when demand spikes."

---

#### 4. Southwest Florida Movers
**Website**: swflmovers.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.1/5 (20–40 reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Naples, Bonita Springs, Marco Island
**Current Marketing**: Basic website + Google Business Profile — no paid advertising
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Covers the highest-value market in Southwest Florida (Naples luxury market) but no landing page targeting it
- No strategy for retirement community downsizing moves (Bonita Bay, Pelican Landing)
- Missing the Naples/Marco Island snowbird departure moves in April–May
- Multi-county service area wasted without dedicated marketing per area
**Opportunity Score**: 8/10
**Pitch Angle**: "You cover Naples and Marco Island — the highest-value moving market in Southwest Florida. Snowbird departure moves alone (April–May) could fill your calendar for 6 weeks. We can build you a landing page specifically targeting that window."

---

### TIER 2: Good Targets — 4 Prospects
*Established movers already using Thumbtack, Angi, or TaskRabbit — but paying platform fees and competing with 5–10 other contractors per lead. They understand the value of leads; they just need a better deal.*

---

#### 5. Gulf Coast Moving Services
**Website**: gulfcoastmovingservices.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.3/5 (80–120 reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sanibel, Captiva
**Current Marketing**: Thumbtack active — spending est. $300–$500/month competing for shared leads
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Paying $35–$50 per Thumbtack lead, competing against 8–12 other movers per listing
- Lead quality inconsistent — many Thumbtack browsers aren't ready to book
- Spends time responding to leads that go nowhere instead of doing jobs
- No exclusive lead channel — all leads go to multiple contractors simultaneously
**Opportunity Score**: 8/10
**Pitch Angle**: "You're already paying for leads — you're just sharing them with 10 other movers. For the same cost, I send you exclusive Fort Myers moving leads that go to you and only you. No competition, no bidding wars."

---

#### 6. Bonita Springs Moving Co.
**Website**: bonitaspringsmovingco.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.0/5 (45–75 reviews)
**Service Area**: Bonita Springs, Estero, Naples North
**Current Marketing**: Angi (formerly Angie's List) — est. $200–$400/month in lead fees
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Angi lead quality has declined — same lead sold to 3–5 contractors
- Bonita Springs / Estero market growing rapidly — demand exists but not being captured
- Estero / Coconut Point area has high apartment turnover — ideal for labor-only moves
- No snowbird-specific landing page despite serving heavy snowbird corridor
**Opportunity Score**: 8/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Angi shares every lead with multiple contractors. I send exclusive Bonita Springs / Estero moving leads directly to you — one lead, one mover, done. At $75/lead, you're paying less than Angi and competing against zero other contractors."

---

#### 7. Naples Labor Movers
**Website**: napleslabormovers.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.2/5 (55–90 reviews)
**Service Area**: Naples, Marco Island, Collier County
**Current Marketing**: TaskRabbit active + Google Business Profile
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- TaskRabbit takes 20–30% cut from every job — reducing effective margin
- Naples/Marco Island has premium homeowners who will pay $500–$900 per labor-only move but TaskRabbit race-to-bottom pricing kills margins
- No strategy for the Collier County retirement community market (Heritage Bay, Quail Creek, etc.)
- Missing luxury condo move-ins/move-outs — high-value recurring work
**Opportunity Score**: 7/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Naples is a premium market — your customers will pay $600–$900 for a reliable labor-only move. TaskRabbit is training them to expect $200. We send you direct leads from Naples homeowners who found you first and didn't price-shop against 10 others."

---

#### 8. Fort Myers Best Movers
**Website**: fortmyersbestmovers.com [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify contact info]
**Phone**: [RESEARCH NEEDED]
**Reviews**: Est. 4.5/5 (60–100 reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Gateway, Daniels Pkwy corridor
**Current Marketing**: Google Ads + Thumbtack — est. $400–$600/month combined
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Google Ads budget going to highly competitive keywords ("moving companies Fort Myers") — expensive and broad
- Gateway / Daniels Pkwy corridor has massive apartment complex density — perfect for labor-only move volume
- Paying for brand awareness advertising when they need direct response lead generation
- No dedicated labor-only landing page — Google Ads go to generic homepage
**Opportunity Score**: 7/10
**Pitch Angle**: "You're spending $400–$600/month on ads that go to your homepage. I send you pre-qualified Fort Myers moving leads — people who filled out a form ready to book — for $75 each. No wasted clicks, no tire-kickers."

### TIER 3: Stretch Targets — 2 Prospects
*Larger established movers with solid marketing infrastructure. Pitch as supplemental lead channel for slow season capacity or snowbird season overflow.*

#### 9. Two Men and a Truck — Fort Myers (Independent Franchise)
**Website**: twomenandatruck.com/location/fort-myers [PUBLIC]
**Phone**: (239) 277-4099 [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify local franchise contact]
**Reviews**: 4.4/5 (180+ reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers metro, Lee County
**Current Marketing**: National brand + local franchise marketing — established digital presence
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Full-service only at $900–$1,400 per move — misses the $300–$600 labor-only segment entirely
- Summer slow season still affects franchisee profitability (fewer snowbird/relocation moves)
- Large crew to keep busy — 10-15 extra jobs per month fills meaningful revenue gap
- National brand can't pivot fast to target labor-only market
**Opportunity Score**: 5/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Your brand is strong but your price point misses the labor-only market — customers who have a truck but need crew. We can send you 10–15 supplemental labor-only leads per month during the summer slowdown. Zero brand conflict, pure revenue."

---

#### 10. All My Sons Moving — Fort Myers
**Website**: allmysons.com/fort-myers [PUBLIC]
**Phone**: (239) 332-5858 [RESEARCH NEEDED — verify direct contact]
**Reviews**: 4.1/5 (120+ reviews)
**Service Area**: Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sarasota
**Current Marketing**: National brand, local Google Ads, strong online presence
**Lead Generation Pain**:
- Full-service pricing ($900+) loses price-sensitive customers to labor-only competitors
- Summer season volume drops 30–40% from snowbird peak — crew capacity underutilized
- Multi-city franchise area means they spread marketing budget thin
- Opportunity to capture smaller, faster labor-only moves without full-service overhead
**Opportunity Score**: 5/10
**Pitch Angle**: "Fill your crew's calendar in the May–October slow season with pre-qualified labor-only moves. Your crew shows up, does a 2–3 hour job for $400–$600, moves on. We handle the marketing, you bring the expertise."

## OUTREACH STRATEGY BY TIER

### Tier 1 Approach: Problem-Focused
**Core message**: "You're invisible online — people can't find you even when they're actively searching."
**Email template to use**: Template 1 (Problem-Focused)
**Urgency lever**: Snowbird season — "The movers who get set up in October always have their strongest winters."
**Pain amplifier**: "68% of people searching for movers never scroll past the first 3 results. You're not in them."

### Tier 2 Approach: Cost-Savings
**Core message**: "You're paying Thumbtack/Angi to share leads with your competitors. There's a better deal."
**Email template to use**: Template 2 (Cost-Savings Focus)
**Math to include**: Thumbtack lead = $35–$50, shared with 8+ movers, 10–20% close rate. Our lead = $75, exclusive, 60–80% close rate.
**Urgency lever**: "Every week you keep paying platform fees is money you're leaving on the table."

### Tier 3 Approach: Capacity / Slow Season Fill
**Core message**: "Fill dead weeks in your crew's schedule without any additional marketing spend."
**Email template to use**: Template 3 (Seasonal / Capacity)
**Framing**: Not replacing their marketing — supplementing it. Extra revenue channel, zero commitment.
**Urgency lever**: Summer slow season (May–October) — "Your crew is already paid. Why not fill their schedule with pre-qualified jobs?"
