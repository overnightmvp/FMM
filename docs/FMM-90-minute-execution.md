## Phase 1: Foundation (20 minutes)

### Task 1: Market Intel Gathering (5 minutes) ⏰
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress
**Action**: Research local moving operations with weak online presence
- [ ] Google "labor only movers Fort Myers" — find 3–5 companies
- [ ] Google "moving help Fort Myers FL" — note which appear in top 3
- [ ] Check their websites for conversion gaps (no mobile form, no price, no trust signals)
- [ ] Note pricing/service claims and service area coverage
- [ ] Document opportunities (poor mobile UX = our opening)

**What you're looking for:** Small ops (1–5 trucks) with 4+ star Google reviews but a weak or missing website. These are your first contractor targets — they have proven demand but need your marketing infrastructure.

### Task 2: Landing Page Setup (5 minutes) ⏰
**Status**: ⚪ Pending
**Action**: Landing page is already built at `landing-page/index.html` — customize it now
- [ ] Update phone number placeholder with your Fort Myers Google Voice number
- [ ] Confirm service areas listed: Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, Naples, Estero
- [ ] Verify form endpoint points to Formspree (Task 3 below)
- [ ] Test form on mobile — 60%+ of moving searches are mobile
- [ ] Confirm hero headline reads "Need Help Moving? We Send the Crew"

**Do not rebuild the landing page.** It exists. Your job is to activate it.

### Task 3: Lead Capture Setup (5 minutes) ⏰
**Status**: ⚪ Pending
**Action**: Set up Formspree to capture form submissions from `landing-page/index.html`
- [ ] Go to formspree.io → create free account
- [ ] Create new form → copy the form endpoint URL
- [ ] Update `landing-page/index.html` form `action=""` attribute with Formspree URL
- [ ] Set Formspree email notification → your Gmail
- [ ] Submit a test form from mobile → confirm email received
- [ ] Note: Formspree free plan = 50 submissions/month. Upgrade when you hit that.

### Task 4: Demand Validation (5 minutes) ⏰
**Status**: ⚪ Pending
**Action**: Confirm demand and seasonal patterns before spending money
- [ ] Check Google Trends: "moving help Fort Myers" — confirm search volume trend
- [ ] Confirm snowbird season Nov–Apr as primary demand window (arrivals October, departures April–May)
- [ ] Note secondary peaks: May–Aug (summer relocations, school year transitions), Sep–Oct (hurricane recovery)
- [ ] Look at 2–3 competitor Facebook pages — are they running ads? What's their messaging?
- [ ] Document your seasonal budget strategy: heavy Oct–Apr, maintenance May–Sep

**Key insight:** Fort Myers is one of Florida's fastest-growing metros with 18% annual mobility rate (vs 12% national). Demand is real year-round. Your edge is snowbird season timing — get set up in October and own peak season from day one.

## Phase 2: Content Creation (25 minutes)

### Headlines & Copy (10 minutes)
**Core message**: No truck needed. We bring the crew. You move on your schedule.

**Primary headlines (A/B test these):**
- "Need Help Moving? We Send the Crew" ← lead with this
- "Labor-Only Movers in Fort Myers — No Truck Needed"
- "Moving Day Help in Fort Myers — Book Online in 60 Seconds"

**Snowbird-specific copy (seasonal ads Oct–May):**
- "Snowbird Move-In? We'll Handle the Heavy Lifting"
- "Closing Up for Summer? Fort Myers Moving Crew — Same Week Availability"
- "Arriving for Season? Get Your Move Handled — No Full-Service Prices"

**Trust signals to include on landing page:**
- Licensed and insured (required)
- Fort Myers service area map (Gateway, Cape Coral, Estero, Bonita Springs, Naples)
- Price transparency: "Starting at $300 for 2-bed"
- Same-week availability during peak season

### Visual Assets (10 minutes)
- [ ] Crew-in-action photo (real or stock — real preferred, sourced from contractor)
- [ ] Fort Myers local photo or map graphic for trust
- [ ] Before/after staging images (boxes loaded professionally)
- [ ] Google/Facebook review screenshot (even 1 strong review matters at launch)
- [ ] "Insured & Licensed" badge visible above the fold

### Facebook Ad Copy (5 minutes)
**Primary audience:** Homeowners 45–70, Fort Myers/Cape Coral/Naples zip codes
**Seasonal targeting:** Increase budget Oct–Apr for snowbird arrivals/departures

**Ad copy template (Snowbird):**
> Arriving in Fort Myers for season? Don't wrestle with furniture alone.
> FlexHelp sends a professional crew — you bring the truck (or rent one).
> Starting at $300. Book online, same-week availability.
> [GET A QUOTE →]

**Ad copy template (General):**
> Fort Myers residents: moving without hiring a full-service company?
> Labor-only moving crew handles loading, unloading, and heavy lifting.
> You rent the truck. We do the work. Starting at $300.
> [BOOK YOUR DATE →]

## Phase 3: Outreach Preparation (25 minutes)

### Contractor Research (10 minutes)
- [ ] Google Maps: search "moving company Fort Myers" — open top 15 results
- [ ] Filter for: locally owned (not Two Men and a Truck franchise), 4+ stars, 10+ reviews
- [ ] Check their websites: mobile friendly? Price listed? Online booking? Most won't have any.
- [ ] Target: Small ops (1–5 trucks) who clearly rely on word-of-mouth
- [ ] Document in `docs/contractor-research.md` (when created): name, phone, owner name if visible, website quality score
- [ ] Cross-check: Are any running Google Ads? (They're paying already — easier sell)

**Best targets:** Contractors who respond to Thumbtack/Angi requests (they already pay for leads) but hate the bidding model.

### Email / Text Templates (10 minutes)

**Subject line:** "15 Moving Leads/Month — Exclusively Yours, No Bidding"

**Email template:**
> Hi [Owner Name],
>
> I run FlexHelp Fort Myers — a local moving lead service.
>
> You're losing jobs every week to Thumbtack and TaskRabbit because homeowners can't find you in mobile searches. We fix that.
>
> Here's how it works:
> - We run ads targeting Fort Myers homeowners needing labor-only moving help
> - Every qualified lead goes exclusively to you — no competition, no bidding
> - $75/lead. If we don't deliver quality leads, you don't pay.
>
> Most of our contractors close 60–70% of leads. Compare that to Angi's 10–15%.
>
> Can I send you 3 free trial leads this week to prove it?
>
> — [Your name]
> FlexHelp Fort Myers

**Follow-up text (3 days later):**
> Hi [Name], sent an email a few days ago about exclusive moving leads in Fort Myers. Wanted to check — are you open to a quick 10-min call? No pitch, just want to understand your lead volume goals.

### ROI Calculator (5 minutes)
Present this during contractor calls. Make them do the math themselves.

**Conservative scenario:**
- Lead cost: $75 (exclusive to you)
- Average job value: $800–$1,200 (Fort Myers 2–3 bed move)
- Close rate on our leads: 60–70%
- Revenue per lead (expected): $480–$840
- **ROI per closed lead: 6.4–11x**

**Monthly projection (15 leads):**
- Contractor spend: 15 × $75 = $1,125/month
- Closed jobs (65%): 10 jobs × $1,000 avg = $10,000 revenue
- **Net return: $8,875 on $1,125 spend = 8x ROI**

**Comparison:**
- Thumbtack/Angi: $100–250/lead, shared with 3–5 contractors, 10–15% close rate
- FlexHelp: $75/lead, exclusive, 60–70% close rate
- **Our lead is 4–6x more likely to close at 33–40% lower cost**

## Phase 4: Launch Preparation (20 minutes)

### Analytics Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Confirm GA4 property exists for FlexHelp Fort Myers
- [ ] Add GA4 tracking snippet to `landing-page/index.html` (header)
- [ ] Set up moving-specific conversion events:
  - `form_submit` (primary — qualified lead)
  - `phone_click` (secondary — high intent)
  - `map_interaction` (secondary — location intent)
- [ ] Set UTM parameters for all Facebook ad links: `?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=fort-myers-moving`
- [ ] Verify in GA4 Realtime: submit a test form → confirm event fires

### Lead Routing (10 minutes)
**Goal:** Every form submission reaches contractor within 5 minutes. Speed = conversion.

- [ ] Formspree → Gmail notification (instant)
- [ ] Set up Zapier free tier: Gmail trigger → Twilio/Google Voice SMS to your phone
- [ ] Test full flow: form submit → email received → SMS received → time to response < 5 min
- [ ] Create contractor SMS template: "New moving lead — [Name], [Phone], [Move date], [Location]. Reply ACCEPT to confirm."
- [ ] Optional Phase 2: Auto-forward lead to contractor via Zapier → remove yourself from routing loop

### Quality Assurance (5 minutes)
- [ ] Open `landing-page/index.html` on mobile — test entire booking flow
- [ ] Submit test form → confirm Formspree email → confirm SMS notification
- [ ] Verify service area copy is accurate (Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Bonita Springs, Naples, Estero)
- [ ] Check page load speed (target: under 3 seconds on 4G)
- [ ] Verify phone number is clickable (tap-to-call) on mobile

---

## Success Metrics (Next 48 Hours)
- [ ] 3 contractor emails sent (from Phase 3 research list)
- [ ] $30 Facebook ad spend live (test campaign, snowbird or general copy)
- [ ] 1 form submission received (real or test)
- [ ] 1 contractor interest reply (email or text response)

**Do not wait for perfect.** A $30 test campaign with a live form beats a perfect campaign that launches in 2 weeks.

---

## Critical Next Steps
1. **Fort Myers phone number:** Get Google Voice number with 239 area code (Fort Myers) → use on landing page and for lead routing
2. **Contractor outreach list:** Build `docs/contractor-research.md` from Phase 3 Google Maps research — 10 targets minimum
3. **$100 test ad budget:** Facebook Business Manager → create campaign → set $10/day for 10 days → measure CPL
4. **Snowbird timing:** Peak season starts November. Contractors who get set up in October always have their best winter. Do not wait until December.

---

## Seasonal Demand Calendar

| Period | Demand Level | Strategy |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **October** | Rising | Launch ads, sign first 2 contractors |
| **Nov–Apr** | PEAK (snowbird season) | Maximum ad spend $80–100/day |
| **May–June** | High (summer moves) | Maintain $50–60/day |
| **July–Aug** | Moderate | $30–40/day, optimize creative |
| **Sep–Oct** | Hurricane recovery spike | Surge budget if storms hit |

---

**Remember**: This is about generating moving leads, not building perfect systems. Focus on what converts — a working form, a live Facebook ad, and 3 contractor emails out the door. Cut everything else.

**Bottom line:** Peak snowbird season runs November–April. Contractors who get set up in October always have their best winter. Don't wait.
