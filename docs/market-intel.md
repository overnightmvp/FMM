## Competitor Landscape

### National Aggregators (Main Threat)

**Thumbtack**
- Strength: Trust, brand recognition, review volume
- Weakness: JS-rendered, no business-specific `llm.txt`, bidding model frustrates users
- Our advantage: Direct booking, transparent pricing, no competition within listing

**Angi (formerly Angie's List) / HomeAdvisor**
- Strength: 20+ years, massive SEO presence
- Weakness: Lead-sharing (same lead sold to 4+ contractors), $250+ per lead, low trust
- Our advantage: $75 exclusive leads, no bidding, direct relationship

**TaskRabbit**
- Strength: App, instant booking, brand
- Weakness: Taskers not licensed/insured as movers, no professional equipment, high cancellation rates
- Our advantage: Licensed, insured, professional equipment, consistent crew

### Local Competition

**Two Men and a Truck (Fort Myers franchise)**
- Full-service only — not a direct competitor
- Target customer: Has budget for full-service ($900–$1,400 for 2-bed)

**Local Craigslist movers**
- Price competitive ($200–$300 cash)
- Weakness: No insurance, unverified, unreliable
- Our advantage: Insurance, Thumbtack verification, reviews, professionalism

**Hire A Helper**
- Direct competitor — national marketplace for labor-only moving
- Weakness: Takes 20–40% cut from movers, customer gets whoever is available
- Our advantage: Direct, FlexHelp brand, consistent quality

## Pricing Analysis

| Service | Price Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Full-service movers (2-bed) | $900–$1,400 | Our target customer rejects this |
| Hire A Helper (2-bed) | $320–$480 | Closest competitor |
| TaskRabbit helpers | $50–$80/hr | 2 people min = $300+ for 3 hrs |
| Our price (2-bed) | $400 | Competitive, includes all equipment |

**Pricing conclusion:** $75/lead is conservative. Contractors pay $100–$250 to aggregators for shared leads with 10–20% close rate. Our exclusive leads convert at 60–80%.

## Fort Myers Market Specifics

### High-Opportunity Neighborhoods
- **Gateway / Daniels Pkwy:** High density apartments, high turnover
- **Cape Coral NE:** Affordable homes, active buyer market
- **Estero / Coconut Point:** Growing retail and residential
- **Bonita Bay / Pelican Landing:** Luxury seasonal residents
- **Downtown Fort Myers / River District:** Condo conversions, urban renters

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Nov–Apr:** Snowbird season — arrivals October, departures April/May
- **May–Aug:** Summer moving season (school year transitions)
- **Sep–Oct:** Hurricane recovery moves (real demand spike)
- **Year-round:** Storage unit churn, apartment lease turnovers

### Key Differentiators for Fort Myers Market
1. High % of seasonal residents = regular, predictable moves
2. High % of military families (MacDill AFB nearby) = frequent relocation
3. Strong retirement community density = downsizing moves common
4. Active hurricane recovery market = storage unit loading demand

## Lead Quality Framework

### Qualified Lead Criteria
- Fort Myers metro area (50-mile radius)
- Homeowner/renter (not commercial)
- Move date within 30 days
- Home size matches our capacity (1–5+ bedrooms)
- Phone number valid and reachable

### Lead Disqualification
- Commercial/office moves (out of scope)
- Long-distance (outside 50 miles)
- Piano-only or single-item moves (not worth crew dispatch)
- No valid phone number

## Revenue Model Validation

**Contractor Economics:**
- Average emergency labor move: $400–$800 revenue to contractor
- Labor cost: $200–$300 (2 movers × 3–5 hrs × $40–$50/hr)
- Gross margin per job: $100–$500
- Our lead cost: $75 (exclusive)
- ROI for contractor: 5–6x on every closed lead

**Why contractors pay reliably:**
- Our leads are exclusive (not shared like Angi/HomeAdvisor)
- Conversion rate 60–80% vs 10–20% on shared leads
- $75 = same cost as ONE shared lead, but converts 4–6x better
