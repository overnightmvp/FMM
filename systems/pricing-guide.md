## Price Psychology Notes

1. **Show price before asking for contact info** — this is the #1 conversion tactic for movers
2. **Calculator anchors higher, converts lower** — showing $800 for 5-bed makes $400 feel cheap
3. **$75 deposit is a feature** — it signals commitment and filters out tire-kickers
4. **"Balance due on move day"** removes the fear of paying upfront for a service not yet delivered
5. **Never negotiate below base price** — it devalues the service and attracts difficult customers
