## 🚨 Performance Warning Indicators

### Red Flags (Immediate Action Required):
- **CPL over $70 for 3+ days** → Pause poor campaigns immediately; moving leads require more nurture than emergency services
- **Lead acceptance rate under 65%** → Review lead quality (moving leads are planned purchases, harder to verify than emergency services — check geo accuracy and move-date validity)
- **Daily leads under 3 for 2+ days** → Increase ad spend or audit targeting (check for budget exhaustion during peak season)
- **Contractor churn >20%/month** → Review lead quality and contractor relationship management
- **Profit margin under 40%** → Cost optimization required; review ad spend efficiency

### Yellow Flags (Monitor Closely):
- **CPL between $50–70** → Optimize targeting and creative; test snowbird vs. general moving copy
- **Lead acceptance rate 65–80%** → Review qualification criteria; check if geographic edge cases getting through
- **Daily leads 3–8** → Consider budget increase or new campaigns (especially Oct–Apr)
- **Contractor churn 10–20%/month** → Improve contractor satisfaction and onboarding
- **Profit margin 40–60%** → Monitor cost trends; may be normal in early ramp

## 🌴 Seasonal Demand Management

This is the most important operational section for Fort Myers. Moving demand follows a predictable seasonal pattern driven by snowbird migration and school-year calendars.

### Seasonal Budget Schedule:

| Period | Season | Daily Ad Budget | Lead Volume Target | Strategy |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **October** | Ramp-up | $40–50/day | 5–8 leads/day | Launch campaigns, sign first contractors |
| **Nov–Jan** | PEAK (snowbird arrival) | $80–100/day | 12–18 leads/day | Maximum spend, prove model |
| **Feb–Apr** | PEAK (snowbird active) | $80–100/day | 12–18 leads/day | Scale contractors, optimize CPL |
| **May–Jun** | Summer moves | $50–60/day | 8–12 leads/day | School year transition demand |
| **July–Aug** | Moderate | $30–40/day | 5–8 leads/day | Maintain presence, optimize creative |
| **September** | Hurricane recovery | Surge if storm | Variable | Be ready to surge if hurricanes hit Lee County |
| **October** | Pre-season | $40–50/day | 5–8 leads/day | Sign new contractors before peak |

### Seasonal Revenue Projection:

| Period | Monthly Leads (Est.) | Revenue | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| Oct (ramp) | 100–150 | $7,500–$11,250 | Onboarding contractors |
| Nov–Apr (peak) | 200–350 | $15,000–$26,250 | Maximum revenue window |
| May–Jun (summer) | 150–200 | $11,250–$15,000 | Secondary season |
| Jul–Sep (slow) | 80–120 | $6,000–$9,000 | Maintenance mode |

**Annual revenue estimate (full year):** $120,000–$180,000 at current pricing model

### Contractor Invoicing Pattern:
- Moving contractors pay per lead delivered, invoiced monthly
- Issue invoices Net 15 from month-end
- Use Wave (wave.com) for all invoicing
- Flag contractors 30+ days overdue — suspend lead access immediately
- Build reserve: 2 weeks of ad spend held in operating account before scaling

## 📈 Growth Trajectory Modeling

### Conservative Growth (70% probability):
- **Month 1**: 100 leads, $7,500 revenue, 60% margin
- **Month 6**: 250 leads, $18,750 revenue, 65% margin
- **Month 12**: 400 leads, $30,000 revenue, 70% margin

### Aggressive Growth (30% probability):
- **Month 1**: 150 leads, $11,250 revenue, 65% margin
- **Month 6**: 450 leads, $33,750 revenue, 72% margin
- **Month 12**: 700 leads, $52,500 revenue, 75% margin

### Downside Scenario (10% probability):
- **Month 1**: 60 leads, $4,500 revenue, 50% margin
- **Month 6**: 150 leads, $11,250 revenue, 58% margin
- **Month 12**: 250 leads, $18,750 revenue, 63% margin

**Key Success Factor**: Consistent lead quality (>80% acceptance rate) and contractor retention are the primary drivers of growth above conservative scenario. Lose contractors and the model stalls.
