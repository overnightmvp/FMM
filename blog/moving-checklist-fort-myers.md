Moving in Southwest Florida is different from moving in most U.S. cities. Between the seasonal timing, the Florida heat, and the specific logistics of Lee and Collier counties, a good checklist matters.

Here's the complete Fort Myers moving checklist — starting 8 weeks out.

---

## 8 Weeks Before Moving

**Housing:**
- [ ] Sign new lease or close on new home
- [ ] Give written notice to current landlord (most require 60 days)
- [ ] Schedule final walkthrough / inspection at current home

**Logistics:**
- [ ] Decide: full-service or labor-only movers?
- [ ] Get 2–3 moving quotes
- [ ] Book movers and put deposit down (moves book 2–4 weeks ahead in peak season)
- [ ] Arrange rental truck if going labor-only (U-Haul, Penske, Budget)

---

## 6 Weeks Before Moving

**Packing:**
- [ ] Start with items you rarely use (off-season clothes, books, decorations)
- [ ] Order moving boxes (Home Depot, U-Haul, or ask your mover)
- [ ] Label all boxes: room + brief contents ("Kitchen - pots/pans")
- [ ] Create an inventory of valuable items (photos + serial numbers)

**Utilities & Services:**
- [ ] Transfer / cancel utilities at old address (FPL, LCEC, City of Fort Myers water)
- [ ] Set up utilities at new address (schedule start date 1 day before move)
- [ ] Update address with USPS (usps.com/move) — takes 1 week to process
- [ ] Notify: bank, credit cards, insurance, subscriptions, employer

**Florida-Specific:**
- [ ] If renting: document current condition with photos (Florida security deposit law)
- [ ] If buying: set up homeowners insurance before closing date
- [ ] Check HOA rules at new community (move-in hours, elevator reservations, parking)

---

## 4 Weeks Before Moving

**Packing continues:**

## 2 Weeks Before Moving

**Practical prep:**
- [ ] Confirm mover booking + arrival time
- [ ] Confirm truck reservation (rental truck pickup location + time)
- [ ] Reserve elevator if moving in/out of a condo building
- [ ] Reserve parking space close to both properties
- [ ] Plan route from old home to new home (avoid I-75 rush hour: 7–9am, 4–7pm)

**Packing:**
- [ ] Pack all non-essential rooms completely
- [ ] Disassemble large furniture (beds, wardrobes, large shelving units)
- [ ] Set aside "move day essentials" box (chargers, toiletries, 1 set of clothes, snacks, important docs)

---

## Move Week

**Monday–Wednesday:**
- [ ] Finish packing all rooms
- [ ] Confirm everything with mover (arrival time, address, parking)
- [ ] Defrost and empty refrigerator (24 hours before move)
- [ ] Arrange child care and pet care for move day
- [ ] Charge phones and portable battery packs

**Day Before:**
- [ ] Pack your "essentials" box last — keep it accessible (goes in your car, not the truck)
- [ ] Get cash for moving crew tip (optional but appreciated)
- [ ] Confirm truck pickup time and location

---

## Move Day

**Morning:**
- [ ] Walk through entire home — nothing left behind
- [ ] Take photos of every room (proof of condition)
- [ ] Meet movers at agreed time → walk them through the home
- [ ] Have water/snacks available for the crew (especially in Florida heat)

**During the move:**
- [ ] Stay nearby and available for questions
- [ ] Direct movers where each item goes at new home
- [ ] Check off items on your inventory list

**After loading:**
- [ ] Final walkthrough of old home — closets, attic, garage, under sinks
- [ ] Return keys to landlord or confirm with real estate agent
- [ ] Photograph empty home (security deposit documentation)

**At new home:**
- [ ] Verify utilities are active (lights, water, AC — critical in Fort Myers heat)
- [ ] Direct movers room by room for unloading
- [ ] Set up beds first (you'll be tired tonight)

---

## After Moving

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Unpack essentials first (kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms)
- [ ] Test all appliances at new home — document anything not working immediately
- [ ] Locate nearest hospital, pharmacy, grocery store
- [ ] Register for Lee County utilities if not done (or Collier County)

**Month 1:**
- [ ] Update Florida driver's license (required by law within 30 days)
- [ ] Register to vote at new address (vote.org)
- [ ] Find a local doctor/dentist if you've relocated to Fort Myers
- [ ] Update address with IRS (Form 8822 or through tax return)

## Fort Myers-Specific Tips

**Heat strategy:** Schedule your move for early morning (7–9am start). Fort Myers hits 95°F+ by noon in summer. Early morning moves are faster and less exhausting for everyone.

**Hurricane season:** If moving May–November, check the weather 5–7 days out. Have a contingency plan if a storm approaches (most movers will reschedule at no charge for weather).

**Traffic:** Avoid US-41 (Tamiami Trail) during weekday rush hours. Take I-75 or Ben Hill Griffin Pkwy for cross-town moves.

**Snowbird timing:** If moving April–May or October–November, expect higher demand. Book movers 3–4 weeks ahead.
