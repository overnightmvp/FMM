Loading a moving truck efficiently can mean the difference between one trip and two — and between furniture arriving intact or damaged.

Whether you're loading yourself or supervising a labor-only crew, these are the techniques professional movers use on every job.

## 1. Start with the Heaviest Items Against the Cab Wall

The front wall of the truck (behind the cab) is the strongest point. Stack your heaviest items there: refrigerator, washer/dryer, large dressers, bookshelves.

This weight distribution keeps the truck balanced and prevents shifting during braking.

## 2. Load Floor-to-Ceiling in Sections

Work in vertical "columns" from the front of the truck to the rear. Fill each column completely before moving to the next. This creates stability — items support each other rather than shift sideways.

## 3. Appliances Stand Upright, Always

A refrigerator laid on its side can damage the compressor. A washing machine on its side can crack the drum bearings. Always transport major appliances upright.

## 4. Use Every Inch of Vertical Space

Large furniture items create "dead zones" underneath them. Fill these gaps:
- Bags of linens and soft goods go under tables
- Small boxes go in hollow spaces (inside dresser drawers, inside the drum of the washing machine)
- Rolled rugs go along the sides or overhead on top of flat items

## 5. Wrap Everything in Moving Blankets

Every piece of wood furniture should be wrapped in a moving blanket before loading. Corners are the most vulnerable — pay extra attention there.

We include professional moving blankets on every job. If you're loading yourself, rent blankets from U-Haul ($10–$15 for a bundle of 12).

## 6. Secure Everything with Ratchet Straps

Every column of items should be strapped to the truck's D-rings. Tight straps prevent side-to-side movement during turns.

**Tip:** Use two straps per column — one near the top, one in the middle. Never leave furniture free-standing without strapping.

## 7. Heaviest Boxes on the Bottom, Lightest on Top

Inside box stacks: books and kitchen items (heaviest) go on the bottom. Bedding, pillows, lamps (lightest) go on top. Never stack boxes so high they'll tip during transport.

## 8. Disassemble What You Can

Remove legs from tables and sofas. Take apart bed frames. Remove doors from large wardrobes. This creates flat surfaces that stack better and fit through doorways without damage.

## 9. Load Mattresses Last, On Their Side

Stand mattresses vertically against one side of the truck. Don't lay them flat — other items will be stacked on top and compress the springs. Most trucks have mattress rails or can use a mattress bag + flat placement if vertical isn't possible.

## 10. Keep Fragile Items Together and Marked

Create a "fragile zone" — usually the back of the truck (last loaded, first unloaded) — for mirrors, artwork, lamps, and boxes marked FRAGILE. These items should be wedged between soft items and never placed under heavy boxes.

## 11. Box Everything (Even If It Seems Fine to Carry Loose)

Loose items — pillows, blankets, kitchen tools — bounce around and damage other items in transit. Everything that fits in a box should be boxed.

## 12. Close and Lock Before Every Move

Every time you move the truck (even across the street), close and latch the truck door. Items shift during even short moves. One bump with the door open and you're dealing with a much bigger problem.

## Why Hire Professional Loading Help?

An experienced crew loads a 2-bedroom in 2–3 hours using these techniques by habit. DIY loading takes 4–6 hours and often results in:
- Damage from poor blanket use
- Inefficient loading requiring a second trip
- Physical injuries (back strain is common)

A 2-mover crew for a 2-bedroom costs $400 in Fort Myers. That's about what a second truck rental costs if you underestimate space.
