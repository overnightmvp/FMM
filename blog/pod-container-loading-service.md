PODS, U-Pack, SmartBox, and portable storage containers are everywhere in Fort Myers. They're a great option for moves, renovations, and storage — but loading them correctly is harder than it looks.

Here's everything you need to know about hiring professional loading help for your container in Southwest Florida.

## Why Container Loading Is Different From Truck Loading

A portable container has two key differences from a standard moving truck:

1. **No ramp** — most containers sit on the ground or on a small platform, not at truck-bed height. Items must be carried in, not rolled with a ramp dolly.

2. **Weight distribution matters more** — a truck's suspension handles uneven loads better. Containers sit flat, and an unbalanced load can cause structural damage or shifting during transport.

Professional movers who load containers regularly know these differences. Random helpers from Craigslist often don't.

## PODS vs. Other Container Options in Fort Myers

| Container | Size Options | Typical Cost (Monthly) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PODS | 7', 12', 16' | $150–$350 | Most common, good local coverage |
| U-Pack ReloCube | 6'x7'x8' | $80–$150 | Smaller, stacks in larger trailer |
| 1-800-PACK-RAT | 8', 12', 16' | $175–$375 | Good reviews, less common in SW FL |
| SmartBox | 5'x7'x7' | $80–$120 | Budget option |
| Local storage companies | Varies | $100–$200 | Check local Fort Myers options |

**For a 2-bedroom home:** The PODS 12-foot or 16-foot container is most common.

## How Much Stuff Fits in a PODS Container?

| Container Size | Typical Home Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 7-foot | Studio / 1 bedroom | Minimal furniture only |
| 12-foot | 1–2 bedrooms | Standard apartment move |
| 16-foot | 2–3 bedrooms | Most common for SW Florida moves |

For a 3+ bedroom home, you'll either need two containers or a large 16-foot container packed very efficiently.

## Loading a PODS Container: Pro Tips

### 1. Load the Heaviest Items to the Back (Wheel End)
In PODS containers, the "wheel end" is typically the stronger end. Load appliances, dressers, and heavy furniture there.

### 2. Fill Vertically, Section by Section
Same as a truck — fill floor to ceiling before moving to the next section. Items support each other and don't shift.

### 3. Wrap Everything
A PODS container travels by truck over sometimes rough roads. Items that aren't wrapped will bounce and scratch. We wrap every piece of furniture in moving blankets before loading.

### 4. Boxes First (Bottom Layer)
Dense, heavy boxes form a stable base layer. Lighter, fragile items go on top.

### 5. Secure with Straps
Use ratchet straps tied to the internal tie-down rings inside the container. We include straps on every job.

## Pricing for Container Loading in Fort Myers

Container loading is priced the same as our standard labor-only moving service — based on home size and number of hours.

| Job | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Load only (1-bed) | $300 | 2 movers, 3 hrs |
| Load only (2-bed) | $400 | 2 movers, 4 hrs |
| Unload only (2-bed) | $400 | 2 movers, 4 hrs |
| Load + Unload (2-bed) | $400+ | Same crew if same-day |

**Note:** If loading and unloading happen same day (same location), it's one continuous job. If they're on separate days (load at origin, unload at destination later), each is a separate booking.

## Scheduling Your Container Move

1. **Book the container** with PODS/U-Pack/etc. — allow 1–3 days for delivery
2. **Book loading crew** for the day after container delivery (gives you time to confirm it's in place)
3. **Pack all boxes** before crew arrives — we load; you pack
4. **After loading**, call container company to schedule pickup
5. **Book unloading crew** for arrival day at new address — confirm container delivery window first
