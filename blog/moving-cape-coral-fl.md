Cape Coral is one of Florida's most distinctive cities — 400+ miles of canals, a massive grid of waterfront streets, and a real estate market that attracts buyers from across the country.

Moving in Cape Coral has unique logistics that most national moving guides ignore. Here's what actually matters.

## Cape Coral Moving Logistics

### The Grid Problem
Cape Coral is enormous and laid out on a grid. A "Cape Coral address" can range from SE Cape Coral (10 minutes from Fort Myers) to NW Cape Coral (45+ minutes away). Always confirm your exact address before booking movers.

### Canal Access
Many Cape Coral homes sit on canal lots with single-road access. For moving trucks:
- Confirm whether a 26-foot truck can access your street
- Some cul-de-sacs and narrow canal roads require a smaller truck
- Pull-through driveways are common — easier than backing in

### No Public Utility Service (Most Areas)
Most of Cape Coral runs on septic and well water — no municipal sewer/water hookup. If you're moving from Fort Myers proper, this is different. Know your utility providers:
- **Electricity:** LCEC (lee.lcec.net) — must transfer at closing or lease signing
- **Water:** Usually private well — contact county for guidance
- **Trash:** Republic Services (Cape Coral contract)

## Common Cape Coral Move Mistakes

**1. Underestimating truck size**
A 2-bedroom apartment needs at least a 15-foot truck. A 3-bedroom home needs a 20-foot truck. Renting small forces a second trip.

**2. Forgetting about the garage**
Cape Coral homes often have 2-car garages full of outdoor furniture, lawn equipment, and tools. These take longer than expected — factor them into your size estimate.

**3. Booking movers too late**
Cape Coral is growing fast. Moving companies get booked 2–4 weeks out during peak season (November–April and June–August). Book early.

**4. Ignoring the heat**
Start at 7am. Seriously.
