# Labor-Only vs. Full-Service Movers: Which One Saves You More in Fort Myers?

**Target keyword:** labor only vs full service movers
**Search intent:** Comparison — person deciding between options

---

When you're planning a move in Fort Myers, you'll quickly discover two very different price points: full-service movers at $900–$1,400 for a 2-bedroom, and labor-only movers at $400 for the same job.

What's the difference? And which one is right for you?

## The Short Answer

**Choose labor-only if:** You can arrange a rental truck (U-Haul, Penske) or have a PODS container.
**Choose full-service if:** You want someone else to handle literally everything including the truck.

## What Each Option Includes

### Full-Service Movers
- Their own truck (included in price)
- 2–4 professional movers
- Loading and unloading
- Basic furniture protection
- May include packing (often extra)

**Average cost in Fort Myers:** $900–$1,400 for a 2-bedroom local move

### Labor-Only Movers
- 2–3 professional movers
- All equipment (dollies, blankets, straps)
- Loading and/or unloading
- *You provide the truck or container*

**Average cost in Fort Myers:** $400 for a 2-bedroom local move

## The Math: Why Labor-Only Wins for Most Moves

For a typical Fort Myers 2-bedroom move:

| Cost Item | Full-Service | Labor-Only |
|---|---|---|
| Moving company | $1,000–$1,200 | $400 |
| Truck rental (U-Haul, 1 day) | Included | $80–$120 |
| **Total** | **$1,000–$1,200** | **$480–$520** |
| **Your savings** | — | **$480–$720** |

You save $480–$720 on a single 2-bedroom move. For a 3-bedroom move, the savings are even larger.

## When Full-Service Makes More Sense

1. **You're moving out of state** — full-service is the standard for long-distance
2. **You have very large or unusual items** (baby grand piano, custom pool table) — some specialty items require specific trucks and equipment
3. **You want zero involvement** — some people want to pay more to hand the entire job to professionals
4. **Corporate relocation** — many companies pay for full-service as part of employee relocation

## When Labor-Only Is the Clear Winner

1. **You're moving within Fort Myers or Southwest Florida** — local moves don't need the full-service overhead
2. **You already rented a U-Haul** — you're halfway there already
3. **You have a PODS or storage container** — labor-only is designed for this
4. **You're moving 1–3 bedrooms** — the price difference is dramatic
5. **You're a seasonal resident** — moving in/out of a condo? Save hundreds

## The Quality Question: Are Labor-Only Movers as Good?

A common concern: "Are labor-only movers as professional as full-service companies?"

The answer depends on who you hire.

Fort Myers Labor Only Movers is:
- **Fully licensed and insured in Florida**
- **Thumbtack Top Pro** (top 3% of providers, 247+ verified reviews, 4.9/5.0 rating)
- **Experienced** — 15+ years, 10,000+ moves completed

The movers are the same quality. The only difference is who owns the truck.

## What About Packing?

Full-service movers often include packing, or charge extra for it. Labor-only movers typically don't pack — but we offer packing as an add-on for $100/room with supplies included.

If you want everything handled, labor-only + packing add-on is still usually cheaper than full-service.

## The Verdict

For the vast majority of Fort Myers moves:

- **Labor-only wins on price** (save $400–$800 vs. full-service)
- **Labor-only wins on flexibility** (keep the truck as long as you need)
- **Quality is equal** when you hire a licensed, insured, reviewed provider

The only reason to choose full-service over labor-only is if you genuinely cannot arrange a truck — and even then, we can arrange one for just $150 extra.
