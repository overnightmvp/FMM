## Hurricane Season Considerations (June 1 – November 30)

If you're moving during hurricane season:
1. Monitor NOAA forecasts 7 days out: weather.gov
2. Have a rain plan — load in 15-minute windows between storms, or reschedule
3. Most movers will reschedule at no charge for active tropical weather warnings
4. Don't move the day before a storm — you'll be unpacking in chaos
