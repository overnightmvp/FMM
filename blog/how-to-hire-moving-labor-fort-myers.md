Moving in Fort Myers? You have two main options: full-service movers who bring their own truck (and charge $900–$1,400 for a 2-bedroom) or labor-only movers who bring the crew while you provide the truck.

For most Fort Myers residents moving within Lee County, labor-only is the smarter choice.

Here's exactly how to hire moving labor the right way.

## Step 1: Decide If Labor-Only Is Right for You

Labor-only moving is ideal when:
- You've already rented a U-Haul, Penske, or Budget truck
- You're using a PODS or portable storage container
- You're moving a 1–3 bedroom home and want to save money
- You want professional help without the full-service price

Labor-only is **not** ideal when:
- You need long-distance moving (out of state)
- You have no way to arrange a truck
- You need full packing and unpacking services (though this can be added)

## Step 2: Verify They're Licensed and Insured

This is the most important step. Florida requires moving companies to be licensed by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). Always ask:

- "Are you licensed in Florida?" (get their license number)
- "Do you carry liability insurance?" (protects your belongings)
- "Are your workers covered by workers' comp?" (protects you from claims if someone is injured)

**Red flag:** Any company that can't answer these questions clearly, or quotes you cash only with no paperwork.

Fort Myers Labor Only Movers is fully licensed and insured in Florida, and carries workers' compensation coverage.

## Step 3: Get a Written Price Before You Commit

Legitimate moving labor companies will give you a clear price based on your home size, with no surprises.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the base price for my home size?
- What's included in that price?
- What's the overage rate if it takes longer than expected?
- Are there any additional fees (fuel, stairs, heavy items)?

At Fort Myers Labor Only Movers, pricing is transparent and shown on the website before you provide any contact information.

## Step 4: Check Reviews

Look for:
- **Thumbtack** (most reliable for moving labor — verified hires only)
- **Google Business Profile** (cross-reference for consistency)
- **Facebook** (check for complaints in comments)

Watch for fake reviews: generic language, all 5-star with no detail, all posted in the same week.

Fort Myers Labor Only Movers has 247+ verified Thumbtack reviews with a 4.9/5.0 rating.

## Step 5: Book with a Small Deposit

Reputable labor-only movers will require a small deposit (typically $50–$75) to hold your move date. This is normal and protects both parties.

**Red flag:** Anyone who demands full payment upfront before the job is done.

Our deposit is $75. The balance is due on move day after the job is complete.

## Step 6: Prepare Your Home

Before the movers arrive:
- Disassemble large furniture (beds, shelving units) if possible
- Clear a path from each room to the truck
- Reserve parking close to your front door
- Have boxes sealed and labeled by room
- Secure pets and children away from the moving area

## What to Expect on Move Day

- Crew arrives within the agreed window (we call 30 min before arrival)
- Walk-through of the home with your lead mover
- Loading begins — items wrapped in blankets, secured with straps
- You drive the truck to the new location
- Crew unloads and places furniture where you direct
- Final walkthrough → pay balance → done
